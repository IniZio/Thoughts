# Comp2021

Perl is well designed for text processing

Perl features;

- unix-oriented
- interpreted
- build around regex
- doesnt scale well in big programs, since use lots of global variables, unappealing syntax

`my $email = 'someone@gg.wp'`: define variable `$email`. `my` defines the variable locally

`{}` for variable scoping

`$name = <STDIN>`, gets user's input to `$name`

`'$name'`wil print plain '\$name', `"$name"` or `${name}`, will really print variable

`chomp('sdfsdf\n')` removes new line from string



coomparisons

| Numeric | String |
| ------- | ------ |
| ==      | eq     |
| !=      | ne     |
| $\lt$   | lt     |
| $\lt$=  | le     |
| $\gt$=  | ge     |



`" "`, whitespace is true

`"0"` is false

Perl converts string to number when compare number with string using the `==`

`"foo" == " "` is true, since not empty string

Perl converts number to string when compare string with number using the `eq`

`last` is perl's syntax for C++'s `break`



`2..10` is an array from 2 to 10
