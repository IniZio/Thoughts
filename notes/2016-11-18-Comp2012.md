# Comp2012

Better to add virtual keyword in all derived class if the one in base class is virtual

only put `virtual` in class declaration, not in cpp file

==Polymorphism==:  tl;dr base class pointer can point to derived class created object. 

â€‹				Allow us to work with objects without knowing its precise type at compile time

==RTTI==: for checking dynamic variable's type at runtime

```cpp
int main() {
  UPerson* u = new Student;
  cout << typeid(*u).name() // typeid is function to determine type of object, name is function that accepts the object returned by typeid and print typename as string
}
```

`static_cast` : can convert pointer to classes in inheritance hierarchy also. Does not consult RTTI to ensure conversion must run

`dynamic_cast`: only works on pointers and references of polymorphic class (with `virtual` function). Consults RTTI to ensure result points to valid complete object. Otherwise return NULL pointer

For overloading, which function to use is decided by compiler. There is no dynamic binding.

For overriding, it is only possible for inheritance and dynamic binding, no overriding if no inheritance. which method to use is decided at moment the method is called. Only applies for member methods, not global functions
