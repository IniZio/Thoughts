What explains Japan's miracle:

- development state: engage in planning and picking the winners
- good state-business relations
- life long employment company loyalty

Japan before WWII

- had different path from China due to threat of colonialism
- origin of lifelong employment: super-profits from colonies enabled the companies to pay works high wages and benefit, and since industrialization is rapid, not enough labor and since learnt from capital-labor conflicts in west

Japan after WWII

- US wanted to weaken Japan before 1940s

- US reversed it policies to strengthen Japan after 1970s:

  - supplied contracts
  - opened US market to Japan products
  - helped Japan secure raw materials from other Asia nations
  - let Japan set up import and investment restrictions

- Japan's cultivated companies trying to fight back labor protests:

  - set up subcontractor system with 2 tiers(core & periphery), so instead unifying, labors try to get to core section, splitting up the labor market

- Japan started a new regionalization strategy since 1970s

  - flying geese ideology(Japan as leading geese)
  - production cycle and relocation of labor-intensive industries to east asia
  - share its tech and ownership with domestic companies

  $\to$  become leader of east asia
