# Isom2030

Trademark is most location-specific, is subjective, has fair use, must be registered, not absolute protection, cheap.

patent + copyright give firm time to build brand, which is more important eventually.

Trademark cannot be generic or functional

Trademark problems:

- token usage: fake, to occupy the trademark
- uniqueness
- foreign words
- same functions? secondary meaning?
- disclaimers

Trademarks include more areas nowadays e.g. service mark, certification mark, collective mark

Ghost application is not permitted (imaginary product)
