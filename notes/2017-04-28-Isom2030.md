When patent doesnt work:

- software: often not qualify, protected by different type of IP law e.g. copyright, trade secret, trademark
- semiconductors: not protected, since need too long time
- small business: cannot afford, and even if did get one you cannot afford to enforce it

One way to legally stop reverse engineering:

- combine encryption and process with compiled code distribution of programs

Internet law: law of the backbone of the internet

Fair use doctrine is not a nice defense in Internet since there copies are made a lot of times, since each buffer is a copy

Cyberspace is still held liable for violations of laws in any jurisdiction from which citizens of nation can view their websites

Contract law differs by country:

- strict requirement for complete acceptance vs. judge create contract

Contract is civil law, sometimes its a way to clarify agreement. This kind of contract is seldom brought to court unless the relationship is in trouble

Important to state clear of the guarantees in the warantee/disclaimer terms. If it is unclear it will favor customers

Puffing is allowed tho (e.g. 'The greatest car!' slogans )
