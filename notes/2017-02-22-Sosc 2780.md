# Sosc 2780

classical dependency theory: best applied to colonies exploited by Europeans in 19th century up to 1960s

Even after becoming independent, the one-crop economy still depend on Foreign, still like industrialization, still little autonomy due to debt

It is said that third world is like 'peripheral' with foreign control as 'core'

'Triple alliance', including multinationals & nation-state & local capital , introducted industrialization to third world



#### Multinational corporations

before, national corporations only invest locally, and serve local's interest

since 1970s multinational corporations brought differences:

1. investments/loyalty not tied to particular natioin
2. promote industrialization over globe
3. provide capital + tech
4. recruit globally



#### National/local capital

before 1980s, dependent capitalists served as compradors to foreign monopoly, locals cant set up its own firms

Rise of nationial/local capital brought differences:

1. nationalists: aims to promote national development instead of just for self-interest
2. market too big for monopoly from foreigners
3. waits for golden opportunities (e.g. war, war recession)
4. provides managerial expertise & local market info

#### Nation-state

before 1970s, states (dependent/laissez-faire) only wanted to keep stuff as they were, collect tax & extract resources aka do as little as possible

developmental state makde development more actively:

1. infrastructure e.g. high-speed freeway
2. social services e.g. education
3. incentives to business e.g. loans
4. regulations e.g. tariffs/quota to protect domestic market
5. strategic planning e.g. help green industry more



Conflict between 'Three Alliance':

1. multinationals: dun wanna share high-tech, just wanna give low-tech to third world
2. nation-state: promote nationalism to make nation stronger, dun wanna give foreigners preferential treatments
3. national/local capitalists: want more autonomy & expansion, wanna challenge foreign corporation instead of being forever junior partner

Dependent Development:

- althought it brings development, the development itself depends on outsiders
- local industry cant catch up to foreign
- political implications: state surpresses other ways from local
- sinces the benefit is top down, income benefits not shared by poor
- cause environmental problems and cant have sustainable development (since only carry about stat sheet this year, not future plannings)
- the partnership is fragile
