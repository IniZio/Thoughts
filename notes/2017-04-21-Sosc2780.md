Hong Kong has always been China-oriented despite being turned into British colony

During the chinese communist revolution, china set up a solid border to separate HK from China, scared of spy from capitalist countries
$\to$ HK became a dead port because there is not more China trade, and suffer from unemployment
$\to$ to survive HK did de-nationalizationi, re-oriented itself from China by doing export-led industrialization

Due to cold war,
$\to$ refugee capital from China, refugee labor who can take any job, mainland subsidized cheap commodities

Reason that communist didnt just take back HK:

- HK was used to break US economic blockage to earn foreign currency
- therefore didnt need authoritarian state to suppress labor and promote export
- in fact china tried to stabilized the situation
