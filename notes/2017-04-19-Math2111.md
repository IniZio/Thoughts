Inner product

for two vectors, u $\cdot$ v = $u^Tv$ = $u_1v_1+...u_nv_n$

norm (aka. length) of vector u = ||u|| = $\sqrt{u\cdot u}$

two vectors are orthogonal (aka. perpendicular) if u $\cdot$ v = 0, also means ||u+v||$^2$ = ||u||$^2$ + ||v||$^2$

a vector can be orthogonal to a set of vectors if it is orthogonal to every single vector in the set

for a set of vectors S, $S^{\perp}$ = $(Span S)^{\perp}$ , and $S^{\perp}$ is a subspace
from this we can prove that $(RowA)^{\perp}$ = Nul A, since $(Row A)^{\perp}$ = $(Span\{b_1^T ....\})^T$ = $(\{b_1^T...\})^{\perp}$
