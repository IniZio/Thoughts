Most important rule of copyright: worth to sue

First Sale Doctrine case Example

- you cannot copy the thing u buy and sell to others, but can sell and modify wt you bought
- Contracts that limits copyright will not be able to sue copyright.
- Copyright can be sued with greater amount and is per copy, than contract breaching

**Performance rights reserved**

- Is a powerful right that limit ppl to only be able to share privately (include indoor home, rented hotel room). Except for purely pictorial work and sound recordings. E.g. if you have an original painting, you can show anywhere, but if its copy e.g. on magazine you cant share it
- Exclusion of sound recordings is important since this means performers dun need and dun have rights to royalties of song, while compose still have the right

**Limitations on performance rights**

- Types of performance like face-to-face education, religious worship, non-commercial charitable, transimitted devices at home (e.g. speakers)(bluebooth itself is public but since limited reception is ok), fairs, performance by or for handicapped
- But if it indirectly benefit someone commercially will violate copyright

**Display rights**

- owner can broadcast his image
- someone who buy a copy cannot broadcast it via Internet (but often not sued cuz its not worth to sue)
- RIght to make image available outside one location is restricted to original work owner

**Digital Transmission rights**

- Sound recordings added new rights in 1995. Have full rights to any digital transmissions of their works and can get fees
- Radio stations do not have to pay

**Advanced Digital Technologies** (DMCA)

- Breaking encryption is illegal (only in USA tho since DMCA is only in USA)(not VCD tho since it is not encrypted)
- Limit on digital copying machine sales: must have Serial Copy Management System
- Can add digital watermarking on music, videos (not counted as modification since its not noticed unless using special method)
- Critized to harm innovations since easy to break with innocent behaviours

Copy Infringement

- Does not need to be intentional (Epic fail of George Harrison)
