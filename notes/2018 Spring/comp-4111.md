configuration item: aggregation of software and hardware for configuration management

2-way async RPC solves all problems of 1-way RPC, but is really hard to implement

ORB are like older versions of JSON

#### CORBA

Fault tolerance: It keeps replications of a same object in a object group, so if one fails others can replace it. It is transparent to client

`<dbs:book xmlns:dbs="https://www-dbs/abs"></dbs:book>`: A xml tag namespaced under "https://www-dbs/abs" and abbreviated to `dbs`

#### JSON

- machine-readable
- supports unicode
- self-documenting format, strict syntax
- can present records, lists, trees

cons of JSON:

- no namespace, metadata
- not extensible

#### REST

A representation of the resource is returned, and it places the client in a new state

Difference of RPC:

- a resource is not in url, rather got by calling interface
- server is not l ike a hash table but a pool of objects
- Stateful, so server maintains the state

#### Processes

- Use shallow copy for resources


- Process 0 and 1 are created by kernel. 
- Process 1 is ancestor of all other processes

#### Concurrency

- Gives illusion that processes are run in parallel. 
- Master process hands out connections, so its like `fork()` then `accept()`
- Benefits:
  - preserve the s/w structor
  - isolates client from server
  - interactions are handled and hidden by OS
- M

#### Multi-thread

- like multiple processes, but forking leaves addresss space alone
- all threads share the same memory. one stack per thread
- benefits:
  - simple ot use
  - easier to have different kind of memory e.g. shared web cache
- Ugly:
  - need to know locking
  - easy for one thread to corrupt other

GPU: same program multiple data

### Architectural style / pattern

Pipe and filter

Layered structure:

- partition the system: each layer solely relies on services from layer below, and solely exports services to the layer above. AKA cannot cross layers
- inferface between layers define interaction: hides implement details

Application layer (7th): service, interface, protocol. internet architecture does not have  has session and presentation layers

content:

- config manage
- rpc, encoding, restful, web service, component-based web developing, satic analysis, FP, parallel programming (hardware / software), architectural styles

config management:

- main reasons to do it
- basic concepts: version, baseline, promotion, release, revision
- differences between CVS and git (slide has a table)
- four forms of CM using git

RPC:

- definition
- wts sync and async rpc
- good and bad about rpc compared to restful (slide has table)
- wts stub / skeleton
- dun need to understand DCOM

Encoding:

- whats good and bad about XML
- whats good and bad about IIOP
- can you write a simple JSON definition for a JAVA class?

Restful:

- definition
- pros and cons of using it when implementing same functions
- basic structure of http protocol
- why cookie is important for http / restful

Web services:

- basic componants of web service
- whats SOAP,  WSCL, UDDI

component-based

- basic concepts
- whats a container, wts good about the idea of using container
- whats a session bean, entity bean
- wts persistence and how container supports it
- wts home interface, remote interface?

static analytics

- definition and why would u use it
- can u do a symbolic execution?
- whats a graph-based static analysis

Functional programming

- can u write a java function that takes a java lambda expression

parallel programming (hardware)

- wts hyper threading
- basic definition of multi core
- wts cache coherence problem
- basic architecture of GPU

parallel (software)

- diffference between process and thread
- event-based parallel processing
- basic definition of MPI
- pro/cons of process and thread
- basic steps of CUDA-based GPU programming
- compare MPI and RPC
