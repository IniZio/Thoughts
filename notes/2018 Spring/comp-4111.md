configuration item: aggregation of software and hardware for configuration management

2-way async RPC solves all problems of 1-way RPC, but is really hard to implement

ORB are like older versions of JSON

#### CORBA

Fault tolerance: It keeps replications of a same object in a object group, so if one fails others can replace it. It is transparent to client

`<dbs:book xmlns:dbs="https://www-dbs/abs"></dbs:book>`: A xml tag namespaced under "https://www-dbs/abs" and abbreviated to `dbs`

#### JSON

- machine-readable
- supports unicode
- self-documenting format, strict syntax
- can present records, lists, trees

cons of JSON:

- no namespace, metadata
- not extensible

#### REST

A representation of the resource is returned, and it places the client in a new state

Difference of RPC:

- a resource is not in url, rather got by calling interface
- server is not l ike a hash table but a pool of objects
- Stateful, so server maintains the state
