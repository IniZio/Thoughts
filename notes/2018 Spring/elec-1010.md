## Introduction

### Signal

> Pattern or variation that carries information

#### Rules

- Signal may bring stimulation or enjoyment
- If the pattern is constant, then it does not carry information, thus is not a signal.
- Signal can be variation of physical quantity over time.
  Signal can also be variation of physical quantity over space.
  Signal can be variation of quantity over both time and space
  - Everything can be modeled as system with signal input and signal output

#### Definitions
- **Temporal signal**: A snapshot signal e.g. Camera accepts snapshot of light into spectrum which converts to electric signal accepted by the chip, which thus produces the image.
- Digital signal: signals defined only a discrete time distances and can take on finite set of values
- Sinusoidal signal: $A \sin(2 \pi f t)$

#### Sound

> Frequency is the repetitive pattern in sound bite that results in a pitch

Our ears distinguish sounds by 3 attributes: pitch (frequency), loudness (amplitude), timbre (harmonics / shape)

###### Definitions

- 2nd harmonic: twice the frequency of sinusoidal signal

###### Tools

- Spectrum graph: show, over a time interval of concern, the amplitude or amount of energy in different frequencies
