## Introduction

### Signal

> Pattern or variation that carries information

#### Rules

- Signal may bring stimulation or enjoyment
- If the pattern is constant, then it does not carry information, thus is not a signal.
- Signal can be variation of physical quantity over time.
  Signal can also be variation of physical quantity over space.
  Signal can be variation of quantity over both time and space
  - Everything can be modeled as system with signal input and signal output

#### Definitions
- **Temporal signal**: A snapshot signal e.g. Camera accepts snapshot of light into spectrum which converts to electric signal accepted by the chip, which thus produces the image.
- Digital signal: signals defined only a discrete time distances and can take on finite set of values
- Sinusoidal signal: $A \sin(2 \pi f t)$
- Fundemental frequency: HCF of the frequencies of the waves

##### Examples

- A signal is composed of its 2nd, 4th, 7th harmonics, the 2nd harmonic is 2Hz. THe 2nd harmonic, 4th harmonic and 7th harmonic have amplitude of 10, 14, 7 respectively.
  1. Express the signal in time domain as sum of sine function. 10sin(2$\pi$2t) + 14sin(2$\pi$4t) + 7sin(2$\pi$7t)
  2. find the fundemental frequency and corresponding preiod of the signal. 1Hz, 1s

#### Sound

> Frequency is the repetitive pattern in sound bite that results in a pitch

Our ears distinguish sounds by 3 attributes: pitch (frequency), loudness (amplitude), timbre (harmonics / shape)

###### Definitions

- 2nd harmonic: twice the frequency of sinusoidal signal
- 'over a time interval of concern': Since even if play one specific note only, it changes over time, so we observe how the harmonics change with time for a specific note i.e. **spectrogram**. We then average it to get a continuous distribution from it.

###### Tools

- Spectrum graph: show, over a time interval of concern, the amplitude or amount of energy in different frequencies
- 2 ways to represent signal: `v(t)` i.e. time-domain or `v(f)` i.e. frequency-domain
  - time-domain: amplitude change of signal over time
  - frequency-domain: draw the maginitude of sine-wave over different frequencies at specific time. Use since we can sense a sine-wave. 32
- FIlters: high-pass (**only allow** higher frequencies), low-pass, band-pass
- Applying a filter with amplitude not 1 can multiply the amplitude of original signal in the graph

#### EM wave

#### Cellular systems (1G)

> Uses  < 1GHz

Multiple users talk to same base station using FDMA (frequency division multiple access). Original sound signal is moved to high frequency by multplying anothe signal i.e. mixing,. It contains both the sum and differences

When waves are mixed, it results in 2 new sine waves, one at frequency (f_1 + f_2) and hte other at (f_1 - f_2).

##### Why modulation:

- low frequency em waves do not propagate
- size of antenna needed to radiate EM wave is proportional to wavelength
- many signals are sent, need to distinguish them and do not conflict

##### Amplitude modulation (AM)

low-frequency signal is also referred as "baseband signal".

After modulation, the two waves are around the original carrier signal, and are symmetric

In AM (amplitude modulation) e.g. radio station, we simply multiply the baseband with the carrier wave. FM has higher quality since the bandwidth is wider

To demodulate a signal from radio statio: use **coherent**.

For older radio, they use 'envelopes' to demodulate signals, i.e. observes the general shape

#### Bell's phone

Since I = V / R, we modulate the resistance, so I = V / R(t) = I(t)

##### Problems:

- attenuation: reduction in amplitude of signal
- distortion: signal changed in non-linear way, due to the transmission medium
- noise: random garbage signal due to environment

Solutions:

- BInary digital system: boolean algebra. Receiver take average value of signal over 1 bit time. Then take it as threshold for 0 or 1


#### Analog to Digintal conversion

##### Digitization

Two operations of digitization:

- sampling: converting analog signal to sequence of numers by measuring signal at discrete time or space instances. i.e. x(t) $\rightarrow$ x[n]
- quantization: putting the samples into binary format i.e. make the values discrete x[n] $\rightarrow$ $x_d$[n]

e.g. x(1.0.01231231) = 4.152V -> x[2] = 4.152V -> $x_d$[2] = $16_{10}$ = $00100_{2}$

> Remember that stereo sound e.g. CD, MP3  has two microphones so double the sampling size

Cannot just set sample rate to how frequent a signal changes, since a singla may change rapidly between samples

Nyquist theorem: If samping rate is 2 x highest frequency of signal, then wont have any errors.

The sampling frequency needs to be slightly bigger than 2x highest frequency tho since otherwise if two frequencies overlap the filter will not get the right shape
