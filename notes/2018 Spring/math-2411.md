## Introduction

### Set

> A collection of objects

e.g {1, 2, 3} is a set.

#### FAQ

- Is {1, 1, 2, 3} same as {2, 3, 1} ? **YES**

#### Vann's diagram

> Set presented interiors of a region on a plane

#### Rules

0. Order and duplications do not matter

1. Let A, B be sets, A is subset of B if all elements $\in$ A are $\in$ B. i.e. **A $\subset$ B**

  â€‹e.g. A is all integers divisible by 4, B is all integers divisible by 2

2. Two sets A, B are same if A $\subset$ B and B $\subset$ A

3. {} = $\emptyset$ , i.e. Empty set.

4. Set with **1** element is **singleton**

5. Set of all positive integers is N, for integers is Z, for rational numbers is Q, for real numbers is R
   N $\subset$ Z $\subset$ Q $\subset$ R

6. Let A be a set, P(x) is a condition. {x $\in$ A : P(x)} is like ensuring all elements in x satisfies P(x)
   e.g. {x $\in$ Z : there exists y $\in$ Z s.t. x = 2y} => set of all even integers
   e.g. {x $\in$ R: x $\ne$x} => $\emptyset$

7. Relationship between sets
   1. A $\cup$ B is appear in either of them.
   2. A $\cap$ B is appear in both of them.
   3. A $\setminus$ B is appear in A but not in B

8. Let A, B be sets. The Cartesian product of them i.e. A x B is the set collecting ordered pairs (a, b) where a $\in$ A and b $\in$ B

   > (1, 2) $\ne$ (2, 1) as ordered pairs

   e.g. R x R = R^2 is the set of all ordered pairs of real numbers, or the set of all points in the plane

9. Let A be a finite set, `#(A)` means number of elements in A

10. nPr = $\frac{n!}{(n-r)!}$, nCr = $\frac{n!}{(n-r)!r!}$

11. Let A, B be sets. A function f from A to B which is a rule assigning a member in B to each choice of a member in A, then its is written as $f: A \rightarrow B$
    e.g. Let P be set of all people, define m : P -> P s.t. m(x) = biological mother for all x $\in$ P

12. Sample space of an experiment is set of all possible outcomes. e.g. die is rolled, sample space is {1, 2, 3, 4, ,5, 6}

13. An event is a subset of sampe space. {1, 3, 5} is in possibilities of sample space of a die so is event. E.g. Getting {(1, H), (3, H), (5, H)} is the event for throwing a die and a coin to get odd number and head

14. P(A | B) = $\frac{A \cap B}{P(B)}$. Because calculating it is restricting sample space to B

15. Rule of multiplication: If A $\in$ B $\in$ C, then P(C) = P(C | B) P(B | A) P(A)

#### Definitions:

- Let S be sample space of an experiment. **Probability** means a function from a set of all events to [0, 1] s..t. 
  - 1) P(S) = 1 and P($\emptyset$) = 0
  - 2) If A_1, A_2 are pairwise disjoint events (i.e. wont hapen at same time, we call them mutually exclusive), then P(A_1 $\cup$ A_2 ...) = P(A_1) + P(A_2) + .... 
- If P(A | B) = P(A) or P($A \cap B$) = P(A) P(B), that means they are independent

#### Theorems

- **Associative law**:
  1. (A $\cup$ B) $\cup$ C ===  A $\cup$ (B $\cup$ C)
  2. (A $\cap$ B) $\cap$ C ===  A $\cap$ (B $\cap$ C)


- **Distributive law**: let A, B, C be sets

  1. (A $\cup$ B) $\cap$ C = (A $\cap$ C) $\cup$ (B $\cap$ C)
  2. (A $\cap$ B) $\cup$ C = (A $\cup$ C) $\cap$ (B $\cup$ C)

  Proof of (1) :  is a graph everything is painted

  Proof of (2) : is a graph where only overlaps of C with A and B respectively painted

- **De Morgan law**: let A, B, C be sets

  - A $\setminus$ (B $\cup$ C) = (A $\setminus$ B) $\cap$ (A $\setminus$ C)
  - A $\setminus$ (B $\cap$ C) = (A $\setminus$ B) $\cup$(A $\setminus$ C)

  Proof of (1): is a graph where only part of A that is not covered by B nor C is painted

  Proof of (2): is a graph where part of A that is not covered by (B $\cap$ C) is painted

  >  Remark: if A is set of everything in our context, Then A $\setminus$ B will also be denoted by $B^C$, so it is rewritten as (B $\cup$ C)^C = $B^C \cap C^C$ and (B $\cap$ C)^C = $B^C \cup C^C$

- If A, B are disjoint finite sets i.e. A $\cap$ B = $\emptyset$, then #(A $\cap$ B) = #(A) + #(B)
  Proof: very difficult

- **Principle of inclusion-exclusion**: Let A, B be finite sets, then #(A $\cup$ B) = #(A) + #(B) - #(A $\cap$ B)
  Proof: since A and B $\setminus$ A are disjoint, #(A $\cup$ (B $\setminus$ A)) = #(A) + #(B $\setminus$ A) -> #(A $\cup$ B) =#(A) + #(B $\setminus$ A).
  And same for (A $\cap$ B) and B $\setminus$ A, #((A $\cap$ B) $\cup$ (B $\setminus$ A)) = #(A $\cap$ B) + #(B $\setminus$ A) -> #(B) =#(A $\cup$ B) + #(B $\setminus$ A).
  Put (2) in (1) then we get the principle
  e.g. A team has 23 players, 17 can kick with right foot, 8 can kick with left. 
  as corresponded to the principle formula: 23 = 17 + 8 - #(A $\cap$ B), #(A $\cap$ B) = 2
  Also  #(A $\cup$ B $\cup$ C) = #(A $\cap$ B $\cap$ C)

  also #(A$\cup$B$\cup$C) = #(A) + #(B) + #(C) - #(A $\cap$ B) - #(B $\cap$ C) - #(C $\cap$ A) + #(A $\cap$ B $\cap$ C)

- **Principle of multiplication**: If A, B are finite sets, #(A $\times$ B) = #(A) $\cdot$ #(B)
  Proof: By induction on #(B).
  Now if #(B) = 0 i.e. B is empty set, s.t. A x B = empty set. So LHS === RHS
  Suppose the formula is true whenever #(B) = k, and that #(B') = k + 1 i.e. B' is {b} $\in$ B
  for some b $\in$ B' and $\notin$ B s.t. #(B) = k, then #(A x B') = #((A x B) $\cup$ (A x {b}))
  then #(A x B') = #((A x B) $\cup$ (A x {b})) = #(A x B) + #(A x {b}) = #(A) x (#(B) + 1) = #(A) x #(B')

  > If #(A) = n and #(B) = m, then there are n x m ways to choosing one from A and then one from B

- Let S be set of n members, and number of sequences of r distinct objects in S is $n P r$ . If n is a positive integer, then n! = n(n-1)...1 and 0! = 1
  Proof: To create the sequence in S, have n ways to choose an object in S and then (n - 1) ways to choose one again different from the previous, the (n - 2) for third one ..... 

#### Proof's

###### nCr

To create a sequence of r distinct objects in S:

1st method: there are n!/(n-r)! ways

2nd method: step 1 is choose r distinct objects in S, or choose subset of S consisting of r members. There are n!/(n-r)!r! ways

###### Refer to definition(1), for each A $\in$ S P(S \ A) = 1 - P(A)

Observe A, S\A are mutually exclusive, so by 2), P(A $\cup$ (S\A)) = P(A) + P(S\A), 1 = P(S) = P(A) + P(S\A). So can write S\A as $A^C$

###### Princliple of inclusion-exclusion

Since A, B\A

#### Questions

1. How many different straight flushes are there in poker?
   There are 4 ways to make a suit, 10 ways to make a straight, so #(A) x #(B) = 40 ways

2. How many 4 of a kind are there in poker?
   There are 13 ways to find 4 cards of same value, then 48 ways to find the fifth card, so 13 * 48

3. How many ways to assign 8 players to 5 roles?
   Create a sequence of 5 different players in this squad, so there are 8! / 3! ways

4. How many hands in poker with 5 cards?
   52! / (5! 47!)

5. How many ways to arrange n red balls and m green balls into a sequence?
   First have (n+m)! / (n!) ways to choose n members from all balls
   Then for each j, put red in jth slot whenever j $\in$ R
   Then put m green balls into the remaining slots

6. How many queues of 1, 2... , n so that the number j is located at jth slot for certain j?
   Let A_j be set of all queues in which j is located at te jth slot
   for each j, Target #($A_1 \cup A_2 \cup ... A_n$)  = #($A_1$) + .... #($A_n$) - #($A_1 \cup A_2$) - ... + #($A_1 \cup A_2 \cup A_3$) ...

   | k    | a single term in kth row    | # of terms in the kth row |
   | ---- | --------------------------- | ------------------------- |
   | 1    | #(A_1) = (n-1)!             | n                         |
   | 2    | #(A_1  $\cap$ A_2) = (n-2)! | n(n-1) / 2!               |
   | 3    | (n-3)!                      | n(n-1)(n-2) / 3!          |

   so in the end its n!(1 - 1/2! + 1/3! ... + (-1)^{n-1} / n!), similar to n!(1 - 1/e)

7. Family with 2 kids chosen at random. Find probability that remaining kid is boy, given one of kids in the family chosen is a boy.
   Let A = event that remaining kid is boy = {bb}, B = event that one of the kids is boy = {bb, bg, gb}
   So P(A | B) = 1/3

8. Have n red balls and m green balls, pick 2 balls without replacement, find probability of getting two red balls
   Let A = even getting a red ball in first trial, B = event of getting two red balls in a row
   P(B | A) = $P(A \cap B) / P(A)$ $\rightarrow$ P(B) = P(B|A) P(A)
   since P(A) = n / (n + m) and P(B | A) = (n-1) / (n + m -1) $\Rightarrow$ P(B) = n(n-1) / (n+m)(n+m-1)
