## Introduction

### Set

> A collection of objects

e.g {1, 2, 3} is a set.

#### FAQ

- Is {1, 1, 2, 3} same as {2, 3, 1} ? **YES**

#### Vann's diagram

> Set presented interiors of a region on a plane

#### Rules

0. Order and duplications do not matter

1. Let A, B be sets, A is subset of B if all elements $\in$ A are $\in$ B. i.e. **A $\subset$ B**

  â€‹e.g. A is all integers divisible by 4, B is all integers divisible by 2

2. Two sets A, B are same if A $\subset$ B and B $\subset$ A

3. {} = $\emptyset$ , i.e. Empty set.

4. Set with **1** element is **singleton**

5. Set of all positive integers is N, for integers is Z, for rational numbers is Q, for real numbers is R
   N $\subset$ Z $\subset$ Q $\subset$ R

6. Let A be a set, P(x) is a condition. {x $\in$ A : P(x)} is like ensuring all elements in x satisfies P(x)
   e.g. {x $\in$ Z : there exists y $\in$ Z s.t. x = 2y} => set of all even integers
   e.g. {x $\in$ R: x $\ne$x} => $\emptyset$

7. Relationship between sets
   1. A $\cup$ B is appear in either of them.
   2. A $\cap$ B is appear in both of them.
   3. A $\setminus$ B is appear in A but not in B

8. Let A, B be sets. The Cartesian product of them i.e. A x B is the set collecting ordered pairs (a, b) where a $\in$ A and b $\in$ B

   > (1, 2) $\ne$ (2, 1) as ordered pairs

   e.g. R x R = R^2 is the set of all ordered pairs of real numbers, or the set of all points in the plane

9. Let A be a finite set, `#(A)` means number of elements in A

10. nPr = $\frac{n!}{(n-r)!}$, nCr = $\frac{n!}{(n-r)!r!}$

11. Let A, B be sets. A function f from A to B which is a rule assigning a member in B to each choice of a member in A, then its is written as $f: A \rightarrow B$
    e.g. Let P be set of all people, define m : P -> P s.t. m(x) = biological mother for all x $\in$ P

12. Sample space of an experiment is set of all possible outcomes. e.g. die is rolled, sample space is {1, 2, 3, 4, ,5, 6}

13. An event is a subset of sampe space. {1, 3, 5} is in possibilities of sample space of a die so is event. E.g. Getting {(1, H), (3, H), (5, H)} is the event for throwing a die and a coin to get odd number and head

14. P(A | B) = $\frac{A \cap B}{P(B)}$. Because calculating it is restricting sample space to B

15. Rule of multiplication: If A $\in$ B $\in$ C, then P(C) = P(C | B) P(B | A) P(A)

#### Definitions:

- Let S be sample space of an experiment. **Probability** means a function from a set of all events to [0, 1] s..t. 
  - 1) P(S) = 1 and P($\emptyset$) = 0
  - 2) If A_1, A_2 are pairwise disjoint events (i.e. wont hapen at same time, we call them mutually exclusive), then P(A_1 $\cup$ A_2 ...) = P(A_1) + P(A_2) + .... 
- If P(A | B) = P(A) or P($A \cap B$) = P(A) P(B), that means they are independent
  e.g. Roll a die twice. Let A be event of getting odd number in 1st, B be event of gett odd in 2nd, C be event of getting odd sum
  P(A) = 1/2, P(B) = 1/2, P(C) = 1/2. P(A $\cap$ B) = 1/4  == 1/2 * 1/2 so they are independent. But P(C $\cap$ A $\cap$ B) = 0 != 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2. A, B, C are independent pairwise, but 3 of them together is dependent
- Let S be sample space of experiment, events S_1, S_2,... form a partition if S_i $\cap$ S_j = $\emptyset$ and S_1 $\cup$ S_2 .... = S
- Let S be sample space of experiment. A random variable is X: S -> R
- Let X: S -> R be a random variable. a, b $\in$ R.
  1) P(X = a) = P({s $\in$ S: X(s) = a})
  2) P(a < X < b) = P({ s $\in$ S: a < X(s) < b })
  3) P(a $\le$ X $\le$ b) = P({s $\in$ S: a $\le$ X(s) $\le$ b})
  4) P(X > a) = P({s $\in$ S: a $\lt$ X(s)})
- Let X be random variable. Cumulative distribution of X is F: R -> R by F(t) = P(X $\le$ t) for all t $\in$ R
- Probability mass function: basically a function listing all possibliites and their corresponding probabilities.
- Cumulative distribution function: like probability mass function but as system of equations
- Discrete random variables: random variables that can only take finitely many possible values or at most countably  many values
- Probabilty density fnction: Area of all possibilities in the graph

#### Theorems

- **Associative law**:
  1. (A $\cup$ B) $\cup$ C ===  A $\cup$ (B $\cup$ C)
  2. (A $\cap$ B) $\cap$ C ===  A $\cap$ (B $\cap$ C)


- **Distributive law**: let A, B, C be sets

  1. (A $\cup$ B) $\cap$ C = (A $\cap$ C) $\cup$ (B $\cap$ C)
  2. (A $\cap$ B) $\cup$ C = (A $\cup$ C) $\cap$ (B $\cup$ C)

  Proof of (1) :  is a graph everything is painted

  Proof of (2) : is a graph where only overlaps of C with A and B respectively painted

- **De Morgan law**: let A, B, C be sets

  - A $\setminus$ (B $\cup$ C) = (A $\setminus$ B) $\cap$ (A $\setminus$ C)
  - A $\setminus$ (B $\cap$ C) = (A $\setminus$ B) $\cup$(A $\setminus$ C)

  Proof of (1): is a graph where only part of A that is not covered by B nor C is painted

  Proof of (2): is a graph where part of A that is not covered by (B $\cap$ C) is painted

  >  Remark: if A is set of everything in our context, Then A $\setminus$ B will also be denoted by $B^C$, so it is rewritten as (B $\cup$ C)^C = $B^C \cap C^C$ and (B $\cap$ C)^C = $B^C \cup C^C$

- If A, B are disjoint finite sets i.e. A $\cap$ B = $\emptyset$, then #(A $\cap$ B) = #(A) + #(B)
  Proof: very difficult

- **Principle of inclusion-exclusion**: Let A, B be finite sets, then #(A $\cup$ B) = #(A) + #(B) - #(A $\cap$ B)
  Proof: since A and B $\setminus$ A are disjoint, #(A $\cup$ (B $\setminus$ A)) = #(A) + #(B $\setminus$ A) -> #(A $\cup$ B) =#(A) + #(B $\setminus$ A).
  And same for (A $\cap$ B) and B $\setminus$ A, #((A $\cap$ B) $\cup$ (B $\setminus$ A)) = #(A $\cap$ B) + #(B $\setminus$ A) -> #(B) =#(A $\cup$ B) + #(B $\setminus$ A).
  Put (2) in (1) then we get the principle
  e.g. A team has 23 players, 17 can kick with right foot, 8 can kick with left. 
  as corresponded to the principle formula: 23 = 17 + 8 - #(A $\cap$ B), #(A $\cap$ B) = 2
  Also  #(A $\cup$ B $\cup$ C) = #(A $\cap$ B $\cap$ C)

  also #(A$\cup$B$\cup$C) = #(A) + #(B) + #(C) - #(A $\cap$ B) - #(B $\cap$ C) - #(C $\cap$ A) + #(A $\cap$ B $\cap$ C)

- **Principle of multiplication**: If A, B are finite sets, #(A $\times$ B) = #(A) $\cdot$ #(B)
  Proof: By induction on #(B).
  Now if #(B) = 0 i.e. B is empty set, s.t. A x B = empty set. So LHS === RHS
  Suppose the formula is true whenever #(B) = k, and that #(B') = k + 1 i.e. B' is {b} $\in$ B
  for some b $\in$ B' and $\notin$ B s.t. #(B) = k, then #(A x B') = #((A x B) $\cup$ (A x {b}))
  then #(A x B') = #((A x B) $\cup$ (A x {b})) = #(A x B) + #(A x {b}) = #(A) x (#(B) + 1) = #(A) x #(B')

  > If #(A) = n and #(B) = m, then there are n x m ways to choosing one from A and then one from B

- Let S be set of n members, and number of sequences of r distinct objects in S is $n P r$ . If n is a positive integer, then n! = n(n-1)...1 and 0! = 1
  Proof: To create the sequence in S, have n ways to choose an object in S and then (n - 1) ways to choose one again different from the previous, the (n - 2) for third one ..... 

- **Baye's theorem**: If S_1, S_2, ... form a partition, then for each event A, P(A) = $\sum_j $ P(A | S_j)P(S_j)

#### Proof's

###### nCr

To create a sequence of r distinct objects in S:

1st method: there are n!/(n-r)! ways

2nd method: step 1 is choose r distinct objects in S, or choose subset of S consisting of r members. There are n!/(n-r)!r! ways

###### Refer to definition(1), for each A $\in$ S P(S \ A) = 1 - P(A)

Observe A, S\A are mutually exclusive, so by 2), P(A $\cup$ (S\A)) = P(A) + P(S\A), 1 = P(S) = P(A) + P(S\A). So can write S\A as $A^C$

###### Princliple of inclusion-exclusion

Since A, B\A

**Baye's theorem**: P(A) = P(A $\cap$ (S_1 $\cup$ S_2. ...)) = $\sum_j P(A \cap S_j) = \sum_j (P(A | S_j) P(S_j))$ since (A $\cap$ S_i) $\cap$ (A $\cap$ S_j) = $\emptyset$ 

Lemma: Cumulative distribution for random variable X is increasing:
Proof: Let t_1 < t_2, {s $\in$ S: X(s) $\le$ t_1} $\subset$ {s $\in$ S: X(s) $\le$ t_2}, so probability of LHS $\le$ probability of RHS

#### Questions

1. How many different straight flushes are there in poker?
   There are 4 ways to make a suit, 10 ways to make a straight, so #(A) x #(B) = 40 ways

2. How many 4 of a kind are there in poker?
   There are 13 ways to find 4 cards of same value, then 48 ways to find the fifth card, so 13 * 48

3. How many ways to assign 8 players to 5 roles?
   Create a sequence of 5 different players in this squad, so there are 8! / 3! ways

4. How many hands in poker with 5 cards?
   52! / (5! 47!)

5. How many ways to arrange n red balls and m green balls into a sequence?
   First have (n+m)! / (n!) ways to choose n members from all balls
   Then for each j, put red in jth slot whenever j $\in$ R
   Then put m green balls into the remaining slots

6. How many queues of 1, 2... , n so that the number j is located at jth slot for certain j?
   Let A_j be set of all queues in which j is located at te jth slot
   for each j, Target #($A_1 \cup A_2 \cup ... A_n$)  = #($A_1$) + .... #($A_n$) - #($A_1 \cup A_2$) - ... + #($A_1 \cup A_2 \cup A_3$) ...

   | k    | a single term in kth row    | # of terms in the kth row |
   | ---- | --------------------------- | ------------------------- |
   | 1    | #(A_1) = (n-1)!             | n                         |
   | 2    | #(A_1  $\cap$ A_2) = (n-2)! | n(n-1) / 2!               |
   | 3    | (n-3)!                      | n(n-1)(n-2) / 3!          |

   so in the end its n!(1 - 1/2! + 1/3! ... + (-1)^{n-1} / n!), similar to n!(1 - 1/e)

7. Family with 2 kids chosen at random. Find probability that remaining kid is boy, given one of kids in the family chosen is a boy.
   Let A = event that remaining kid is boy = {bb}, B = event that one of the kids is boy = {bb, bg, gb}
   So P(A | B) = 1/3

8. Have n red balls and m green balls, pick 2 balls without replacement, find probability of getting two red balls
   Let A = even getting a red ball in first trial, B = event of getting two red balls in a row
   P(B | A) = $P(A \cap B) / P(A)$ $\rightarrow$ P(B) = P(B|A) P(A)
   since P(A) = n / (n + m) and P(B | A) = (n-1) / (n + m -1) $\Rightarrow$ P(B) = n(n-1) / (n+m)(n+m-1)

9. Probability of getting 4 heads when throwing it n times.
   Let A be getting the 4 heads, S_i be getting i when throwing the die
   P(A) = P(A | S_1) P(S_1) + ... + P(A | S_6) P(S_6) = P(A | S_4) P(S_4) + ... + P(A | S_6) P(S_6) = 1/2^4 * 1/6 + 5/2^5 * 1/6 + 6/2^6 * 1/6

10. Have 1% of defect in a population. If a defect test has 0.9 chance return positive if ppl really have defect, but have 0.1 chance return positive if not really have defect. Probability that the ppl really have defect, given the test returns positive.
  P(B) = P(B | A)P(A) + P(B | A^C)P(A^C) = .9 * .01 + 0.1 * 0.99.
  P(A | B) = P(A $\cap$ B) / P(B) = P(B | A)P(A) / P(B)
