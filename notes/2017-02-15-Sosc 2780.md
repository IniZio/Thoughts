New Modernization: As different from old modernization school

- Agree with the critiques metioned last lecture
  - not mutual exclusive but interprenetrating
  - traditional can be beneficial to modernity
- No long uni-directional
- $\rightarrow$  more empirical & more attention in history

**Entrepreneurial Familism**(Wong Siu-Lun, is emigrant):

- Traditional familism perceived as bad, but seems to have made HK succeed in industrialization

- He focus on family factor in HK's industrialization, esp. businessmen from ShangHai that made it successful:

  - Paternalistic management: treak workers like family
  - Nepotism: hire children
  - Family ownership

  $\Rightarrow$ tl;dr Make ppl like family

- Found this style make effciency $\uparrow$ , makes ppl commit for boss not just for salary, gains mutual trust between

- Fits HK business situations: lots of small firms, market demand fluctuates greatly, lots of competition

Copy of Familism didnt work in other places:

- China: Power is all in state's hand, so you can lose properties, rights due to wtever excuse. Therefore hard to promote industrialism and makes familism userless in terms of market expanding
  - Until 1980 reform did state loosen its control, and therefore industries & entrepreneurial familism started to develop, a wave of export-lef industrialization happended in east Asia , esp. 四小龍.
  - $\rightarrow$ Confucianism helped to promote economic success of east Asia

this-word oriented $\leftarrow$ Protstantism + Calvinism vs Catholism $\rightarrow$ other-world directed

How Confucianism help East Asian economic success

- Attention on children's education
- Paternalism: personal management
- Industrial peace: cut down class conflicts
- Civil servants: More comitted & feels higher class
- Developmental state: more state autonomy & state capacity

Need to think about the thesis

- specify the concept of Confucianism
- specify process of how it promoted industrialism
- spell out hte macro global economy at that time
