Inverse of matrix: Let A = $\begin{pmatrix}a&b\\c&d\end{pmatrix}$ , $A^{-1}$ = $\frac{1}{ad-bc}\begin{bmatrix}d&-b\\-c&a\end{bmatrix}$. If ad=bc then NOT invertible

Another way to find inverse: Solve A$A^{-1}$ = I, aka Solve [A|I] $\to$ [I|$A^{-1}$] 

theorems for invertible matrix A:

1. A is row equivalent to I
2. A has n pivot positions
3. Ax = 0 has only trivial solution 
4. columns of A are L.I.
5. x $\to$ Ax is one-to-one
6. Ax=b has at least one solution $A^{-1}b$
7. Columns of A spans $R^n$
