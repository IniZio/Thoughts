Cost of patent

1. File proviional patent application: can be done yourself
2. FIle formal patent: cost significantly (100K) and time
3. Navigate the patent review and appeal: need internal administrative review + external court review, which cost high, and great delays

Should narrow it to protect better, so often multiple patents on same product

Three types granted under US

1. utility: protects product + process inventions
2. design: novel, orignal art
3. plant: only man-made

design patent: closer to copyright, but only articles of manufacture, which copyright does not protect. only 14 years.



#### Statutory vs Common law

statutory: passed by legislative, almost all crimial laws
common: by court decisions, often unclear

If statutory is clear, then court cannot discard it when make ruling.
If statutory favours both, then current maybe look to prior decisions
Higher courts are legalling binding on lower courts. some courts have no official influence on decision (same level)

Administration: law enforcer, legislation: law creator, court: law interpretor

US law structure:

- constitutioin
- federal
- state: e.g. trademark

Federal courts: supreme (can overturn state court) -> federal appeal (appeal of decisions) -> federal trial court (facts)
State court also similar structure

Patent reviewer officer: lowest level to review patents, not adequately strong background
Patent reviewer supervisor: first line management

What to do when patent got rejected

1. negotate with the patent reviewer officer
2. file administrative appeal: scare him politely that you will sue, since cheaper than actually sueing~~



can sell some of ur patents to protect others, since patent protection is an expensive game

in china even if u lose the patent u can bully others by intimidating others in court

even if u win proving the patent is invalid, it just make u have to face competitors that were previously limited by the patent



### MID-TERM

1 discussion question, others MC
