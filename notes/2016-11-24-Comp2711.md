==Theorem:==

If have recurence of the form T(n) = aT($\frac{n}{2}$ ) + n,
where a > 0 and T(1) >= 0
then if a < 2, T(n) = $\theta$(n)
if a = 2, T(n) = $\theta$(n log n)
if a > 2, T(n) = $\theta$($n^{log_2 a}$)

Advanced Induction: for proving stuff that needs you to create assumptions

###### Example 1 (P.10)

Base case:
n = 1 does not work so is not base case
n = 2 $\implies$ T(2) <= k $\cdot$ 2$\log_2 2$ $\to$ T(2)/2 <= k
Assumption 1: $n_0$ >= 1
Assumption 2: k >= T(2)/2

Inductive hypothesis:
if m = $2^j$ and 1<= j < i, then T(m) <= km log m

suppose n = $2^i$, By hypothesis T(n/2) <= k(n/2) log (n/2), so
T(n) <= 2 T(n/2) + cn 
... <= kn $log_2 n$ - kn + cn  // need to make -kn + cn <= 0, so will have Assumption 3: k <= c
<= kn $log_2 n$

Therefore by M.I., as long as the 3 assumptions are satisfied, T(n) <= kn log n, so T(n) = O(n log n)



###### Example 3 (P.62) When statement is too weak

statement was made that T(n) <= $kn^2$, but then cn is positive so cannot prove <= $kn^2+cn$ can be transformed to hypothesis

So use T(n) <= $k_1n^2 - k_2 n$, which works

Base case: 
n=1
T(1) <= $k_1-k_2$ <= $k_1-c$

Inductive step:
c <= $k_2$
