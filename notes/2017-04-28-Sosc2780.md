Taiwan: Authoritarian state (1950s)

- Authoritarianism (martial law)
- economic growth
- anti-mainland

Political challenge for Taiwan in 1970s: got isolated in dipomatic, and protests against authoritarianism and repression
Economic challenge for Taiwan: high cost of production, competitions from other east asia dragons, and protectionism in world economy

$\to$ in 1980s did industrial upgrading (high-tech zones ) and industrial relocation to southeast asia and get access to cheap labor and raw materials, also lifted the martial laws $\to$ democratization

3 actors in unification:

- Mainland (wants to unify):
  - use economic cards to buy off taiwan business
  - empower TNP to weaken DPP
- USA (wants ambiguity):
  - declare its support for one china
  - but sells arms to Taiwan, while warning it to not go too far declaring independence
