# Sosc 2780 revise

What's modernization:

- process of becoming modern
- industrialization, urbanization, democrary, science...
- irreversible, progressive, brings civilization & improve living standard

Policy implication of modernization:

- Americanization, i.e. learning traits of Americans
- to sell American model to third world, so newly independent nation-state wont follow communist states

------

Five pattern variables:

| Traditional         | Modern                 |
| ------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Affective           | affective neutral      |
| particularistic     | universalistic         |
| collective          | self-oriented          |
| ascription          | achievement            |
| funcionally diffuse | functiionally specific |

Achievemnt motivation:

- measured by projection method
- achieving nations have higher of it
- parent socialization is source of it
- policy implication: need to promote entrepreneurial spirit

Critical evaluation of it: only focuses on individual, third world are poor not because of not being ambitious but lack of achievement motivation, not their own fault

------

5 stages of development:

1. traditional society: closed, depend on agriculture, low tech
2. pre-condition to take-off: population growth faster than growth of output, so all consumed
3. take-off: received stimulus, raise productive investment
4. drive to maturity:  growth becomes normal condition, start from one sector to others
5. high mass-consumption society: $\uparrow$ productivity $\to$ $\uparrow$ real income, become mass consumption, growth of service sector, become welfare state

Policy implication from US to third world:  every nation will get to modern as long as have patience yay! $\to$ since that needs investments US can help everything e.g. loans, economic advisors $\to$ dun follow communist model cuz they sux!

Lipset's theory of democrary: more money more likely to sustain democrary, defined by election of government officials

------

|              | Academic critique | Political critique |
| ------------ | ----------------- | ------------------ |
| timing       | earlier           | later              |
| tone         | milder            | harsher            |
| goal         | to improve        | to destroy         |
| relationship | from friends      | from enemies       |

Assumptions of modernization school:

1. Evolutionary assumption (5 stages of growth theory): unlinear developments mean all nations move along the same path, and optimistic in that all nations will develop gradually
2. Functionalist assumption (5 pattern variables): society is social system of coherent values, traditional values are incompatitable with modern ones

Critisms: 

1. Unlinear assumption: is ethnocentric, assumes West is better and third word is backward. with multi-linear development third world can choose paths, and there is possibility of non-development
2. Traditional assumption: traditional is not always bad for modernization, and is not exclusive with modern
3. Methodological problem: only logical and high-level abstractions in 5 pattern variables. American social scientists do not even do local research in third world, and lack of historical research, so cant track process of development

------

New Modernization school:

- agrees something wrong with modernization theory
- traditional can be beneficial to modern
- abandon uni-directional assumption & allow differnet choices of path
- more attention to history

Entrepreneuial Familism: was perceived as bad in classical modernization school

3 traits in HK's industrialization:

1. Paternalistic management: treak workers like family
2. Nepotism: employ children
3. Family mode of ownership

How traits match HK: lots of small firms, market demand fluctuates, highly competitive

Confucianism $\to$ East Asian economic success:

1. invest & attention in education
2. Paternalism (like parents): worker loyalty
3. Industrial peace ($\downarrow$ class conflct, strikes)
4. civil servants higher status & commited
5. Developmental state: $\uparrow$ state autonomy + capacity

Critism to thesis of confucianism and Asian development:

- need to specify concepts of confucianism that helped
- specify process how did it helped
- need to spell out macro global economic and in Asia

------

Dependency theory: is a political critique on modernization, since only blame locals to justify foreign domination, and does not talk about colonialism on purpose

Andre Gundre Frank thinks underdevelopment is by colonialism

'The Political Economy of Growth' by Paul Barn

Colonialism before capitalism: justing looting; after capitalism: de-industrialization

- E.g. cash crop export, one-crop economy, loop-sided unbalanced development

Unequal exchange led to dependency relationship, third world depend on West for tech, market, capital.

West continue to develop like 'core', third world is like 'periphery'

Colonialism's first encounter is war & domination, promotes idea of white superiority. $\to$ cultural domination, racial segregation, exclude native language, rewrite history, colonial mentality

Third world became independent after WWII, but due to debt trap (due to miscalculation of oil profit, buy weapons, infrastructure).

Third world financially depend on West, try to cut social spending (health, education) + state bureaucracy(police), and get more revenue (increase taxes), sell domestic resources (mines), sell public sector (gas, water)

Domestic impacts of the measures: currency devaluation, massive inflation, flight of capical, protests, poverty.

'Triple alliance': Multinationals, nation-state, local capitalists

Triple alliance introduced wave of industrialization

1. Multinational corporations
   - investments not tied to a nation
   - promote industrialization across globe
   - provide capital & tech
   - global recruitment
2. National capitalist
   - aim to promote national development
   - market too large to be monopolized by foreigners
   - waits for golden opportunities (economic recession)
   - provides managerial expertise & local market info
3. Nation-state (as actor of development)
   - infrastructure project (freeway)
   - social services (education)
   - incentives to business (taxes)
   - regulations (tariffs to protect domestic market)
   - strategic planning,  preferential treatments to potential cutting-edge industries

Conflicts between 'Triple alliance':

1. Multinational corporations: dun wanna share high-tech (only give low-tech to 3rd world)
2. Nation-state: wanna promote nationalism, hate giving foreigners preferential treatments
3. National capitalists; want autonamy and expansion (wanna challenge foreign)

Problem due to combination of dependence & development:

- still foreign control on tech, local cant catch up
- authoritarianism to suppress dissents and discipline workers
- income gap widen, poor does not benefit
- environmental problems worse, non-sustainable
- fragile partnership
