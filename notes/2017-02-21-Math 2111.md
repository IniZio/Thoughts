# Math 2111

Basic variables (= pivot columns): at least how many variables do we need to express the solutions, since sometimes one or two variables can be replaced by using another variable to express. 

Free variables (= non-pivot columns = No. of variables - rank of Matrix)

Rank of matrix: No. of pivot positions

A is the coefficient matrix

If (rank of coefficient matrix == rank of augmented matrix) $\Rightarrow$ Consistent, otherwise inconsistent

To prove inconsistent, need to prove rank of coeffieicnt matrix != rank of augmented matrix

If the bottom-most pivot is in augmented column, then it is inconsistent also

A matrix 4 $\times$ 3 $\to$ rank: 3, 4 equations, 3 variables. free variables = 3 - 3 = 0
