# Sosc 2780

**Dependency thoeory**: introduced in 1960s

political critique on modernization school is that it only provides internal explanation (blaming locals to justify foreigh domination), and avoids factor colonialism on purpose (ppl colonised by Britain not happy)



Colonialism before capitalism: just looting & plundering

Colonialism after capitalism: de-industrialization

Cash crop export, price fluctuatio, one-crop economy (e.g. coffee in Brazil), loop-sided unbalanced development

Unequal exchange, pumping of surplus from third world to West esp. England through trading of low-priced agricultural products with high-price manufactured goods



tl;dr;	before colonialism of England, each country use their own raw materials & produce their own manufactured goods that they are gd at, with fair price. but after that they have to export raw materials to England at low price and get manufactured goods at high price from England

The unequal exchanges lead to third-world having to depend on the manufactured products of West.  It is created through invasion/domination, and is decisive factor for making third-word behind 

Even when third-world finally get independent, they are heavily in-debt with West. Mexico president tried to  build infrastructure and lent money from World Bank. but then found cant pay back the debt. Therefore stuck in the debt trap with compound interest & debt addiction

e.g. Austerity Plan: cut all expenses and try to get more revenues to pay debts

Domestic impacts: currency devaluation, massive inflation, flight of capital, economic decline...

Also third-word still have to depend on West since they still need to get loans, technology, markets, etc.
