Risk of violating copyright, you may not be sued now cuz its not criminal, but when you are a nice target to sue (e.g. get rich), it will cost you a lot

Another risk: some way of violating copyright is illegal, e.g. DMCA

Assigment:

The DVD set has bad packaging and less info and is region free, so suspicious that is illegal copy. But it is hard to find the seller on Amazon, and Amazon can claim itself being third-party logistic support and is not distributer. They mention is UK import to remove doubt of low quality, and the sue will go to UK instead of US, and better fair use defense

HK is actually stricter and uploading music is criminal whereas not in US, its more about distributing

Alibaba guarantee quality of some products (even fakes :smirk:), instead of whether is real
