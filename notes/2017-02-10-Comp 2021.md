# Comp 2021

Piping: `<` from right $\rightarrow$ left, `|` default direction (left $\rightarrow$ right)

`tr a-z A-Z < abc.txt` : Replace all lowercase characters with uppercase 

`sort names.txt > name.sort `: Sort name.txt and write to name.sort

`uniq`: same as `sort -u`

Directory is also a file, just that its data is a sequence of inodes(file nodes) with their names

`sort -n`: sort by number instead of as alphabets

`ls | tee output.txt`: tee makes the pipe go to both the output.txt and stdout

stdout, stdin, stderr actualy are counted as device files, they are under `/dev` folder. Also tty's

All files are identified as unique inodes. Only the kernel can manipulate inode itself

Two types of file: ordinary file, directory files

- Ordinary files: Contain the normal data and metadata.

Other types of file:

- Pipe: FIFO
- Link files: allow collaboration of different users from different networks even. Protects the linked file until only one link left for it and it is for deletion

*nix physically use datablock and inode for file storage

Indirects: make inode index of indexes, in order to make inode itself occupy less space

Content of inode: (**Does not contain path/file name**)

- File owner id
- File type (ordinary/directory)
- File permission
- FIle access time
- Number of lines to it
- Table of contents to addresses of data in the file
- FIle size

Standard of *nix regarding capacitiy of file:

- runs with 13 entries
- 1 logical block is 1K bytes
- address of block is 32bit integer

Reserved inode numbers: all system file structures e.g. `/sys`, `/tmp`, usually smaller numbers

What if multiple OS, multiple mount points

File system structure:

- Boot block
- Super block
- inode list
- data blocks

Super block (reference)

- Size of file system
- number of free blocks in file system
- list of free blocks avaliable
- index of next free block
- size of inode list
- number of free inodes
- index of next free inode
- lock fields of free block and free inode lists
- flag of whether super block has been modified
