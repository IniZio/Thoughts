Noverlity requirement:
- Must be new ('anticipated by prior art')
- disclosure more than 12 months earlier in another patent filed in another coutry means not new
- prior art's treatment is incosistent

Events that will make it unpatentable if happen 12 months before application:
- domestic: prioer patent by anyone, publication, public use, sale
- foreign: domestic events + prior patent application by patent - public use - sale

Best way to show utility is sales
- product in commercial sales is clearly userful for ppl paying for it, but needa be careful with novelity bars, so better to file application for patent before starting the commercial sales
- the reason is the right begins from the date of application

You need to prove it is utility since the policy needs patent to be granted for useful arts

courts say oly some useful application need to be identified, but novelty or curiosity along is not sufficient reason to issue patent, even if there is commercial market

marketing efforts may claim benefits that do not exist or hard to prove, not sufficient to profide legally  recognized benefits

Illegal/immoral innovations
- cannot be patented
- maybe granted if some legal or beneficial usage e.g. drugs that can relieve pain but addictive
