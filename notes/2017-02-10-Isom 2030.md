# Isom 2030

Types of infringement:

- Direct: e.g. photocopy textbook urself
- Contributory: e.g. give photocopier for someone to do the direct infringement
- Vicarious: could have stopped the direct infringement, and receives benefits

###### Proof of infringement:

- Need to prove u are the owner
- Need to have evidence that ur work is used for that infringer's work, often need circumstantial evidence. 
  - Better to combine to make the proof more persuasive
  - Proof of access (e.g. the one sued have read the original work before)

###### 2-stage process of reading through proof

1. Did copying occur?
   - Was copying from public of from the suer
   - Did suer also copy work, which makes it not protected actually?se exce
2. Is the copy illegal?
   - Ideas, concepts, method, process have limit on protection
   - Fair use exceptions (forgivable copy, e.g. no economic harm, timeshift)

> What you should think about fair use: risk, hard to predict and shifts

###### Fair use: right to copy

- Defense of fair use admits to copying, but is allowed or permitted to copy
- e.g. face-to-face education, literaray and social critism, parody, 1st admendment activities (e.g. news report, only in US tho)

How far can fair user go:

- NOT specified in terms of quantity of copying
- NOT clear for conditions (e.g. venue) that is allowed for fair use. Can only tell u that no successful sue for that have happened
- Libraries can make limited copies
- Scholarly work can make limited copies (not that favored if wholesale copy)
- 'For-profit' copy likely to not be permitted (exception Google Scholar)

Balancing fair use defense: (these are balanced jointly)

- Purpose, e.g. commercial nature
- How much copied
- Nature of the protected work
- Economic impact of taking
- Intent and motives of defendant
- First amendment interest

Policy issues often in conflict in applying fair use defenses

Registration for copyright not required but needed to obtain "statutory damages" , which often make easier to show actual damages

Remedies for copyright infringement:

- Plaintiff can recover damage ur suffer and benefit the defendant got (Even more if the owner did give notice)
- Repeat offending and highly offensive action more punished hard
- Injunctions often requested e.g. preliminary injuctions during trial

Criminal liability: Infringers may also face criminal liability sometimes

Copyright lasts for holder's lifetime + 75 years
