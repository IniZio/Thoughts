# Math 2111

Linear = degree 1. e.g. $a_1x_1+a_2x_2+....$, no squares

How do we know we have found all solutions of (system of) linear equations

Geometric perspective of system of linear equations: solutions = intersection of planes

- Two planes in each other $\rightarrow$ solutions set is two planes
- Two planes parallel but not touching $\rightarrow$ no solution
- Two planes intersect but not all in each other i.e. intersect at a line $\rightarrow$ solution set is the line

Augmented Matrix operations
- Replacement: multiply one row and add/sub it to another row
- Interchange: just swap the rows
- Scaling: like 0x + 2y = 56 $\rightarrow$ 0x + 1y = 28
