#### Eigenvalue and eigenvector

If for nxn matrix A, Ax = $\lambda$x has non-zero solution x then:

1. $\lambda$ is eigenvalue of A
2. x is eigenvector of A corresponding to its $\lambda$

also means $\lambda$ is eigenvalue if and only if det (A-$\lambda I$) =0 // aka. **characteristic equation**

When solving the characteristic equation, you will it ends up like $(\lambda - 5)^2 (\lambda - 3)=0$, the powers are called **multiplicity** of that eigenvalue 

**Similar matrix**: A is similar to B if there is invertible matrix P s.t. $P^{-1}AP=B$, aka. have same characteristic matrix

Square matrix A is diagonalizable if **similar** to diagonal matrix D.
then each non-zero in D is eigenvalue, each corresponding column in P is eigenvector

e.g. Diagonalize A = $\begin{pmatrix}1&3&3\\-3&-5&-3\\3&3&1\end{pmatrix}$
0 = det $\begin{pmatrix}1-\lambda&3&3\\-3&-5-\lambda&-3\\3&3&1-\lambda\end{pmatrix}$ = $-(\lambda - 1)(\lambda+2)^2$, $\to$ $\lambda$ = 1 or -2
for each possible $\lambda$ solve (A-$\lambda$I)x = 0, get the corresponding basis
D is $\begin{pmatrix}1&0&0\\0&2&0\\0&0&2\end{pmatrix}$, matching with eigenvalues
concat the basis's together, becomes the P
