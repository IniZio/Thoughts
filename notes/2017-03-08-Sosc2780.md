Globalization project is based on state-market relationship

In 1970s globalization project emerged to dismantle import substitution/welfare policies in 3rd world and West $\to$ calls for liberalization of market, cut down of state regulations / services. No barrier of movement of capital, labor, commodity cross border

Ronal Reagan in US and Margaret Thatcher used 'neoliberalism' to promote globalization project, to expand market dynamics, downsize state, free market from state regulations and moving across state borders
$\to$ Barry Bluestone in 1982, the freedom is reflected in 'de-industrialization', many steel & automobile factories suddenly close down. It is just short term tho and no jobs lost. But de-industrialization is real, unionized jobs to non-unionized jobs, well-paid to low-paid, white male to minority



Reasons of de-industrialization (relocate industries)

1. high wages and taxes, strong union in core, so manufactured in US cant compete with 3rd world
2. Big companies like to invest in e.g. stock market, real estate, high-tech that have quick returns

Waves of moving industries: 1st is 4 little dragons, 2nd is china, 3rd is vietnam, india, south africa



Problems of de-industrialization:

1. shut-down blues $\to$ unemployment, divorces, community decay
2. changing shape of regions $\to$ fall of industrial North, rise of industrial in South
3. rise of new ideologies & conservative rights $\to$ blame foreigners e.g. anti-asian migrants, anti-japan, anti-china industries

Suddenly reindustrialization in 1990s

- Firm characteristics: small subcontractors of transnational companies, insecure job, un-skilled, low pay, piece-rate (one product made one salary), bad working conditions
- Worker characteristics: immigrant, illegal status, minority, women
