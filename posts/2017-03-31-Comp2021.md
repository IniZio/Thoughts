# Comp2021

Function reference:

```perl
sub PrintSomething {
  print "Hello something";
}
# reference the function
@something = \&PrintSomething;

# call using reference
&$something();
```

Array is greedy, if you do something like `my (@array, $str) = @_;` , `$str` will be empty since the `@array` will include wt is supposed to be passed to `$str` 
Solution is pass the array by reference at function call `abc(\@f, $k);`, then iin the function using the array will be like `@$array`
