#### Elementary matrix:

1. each elementary matrix is invertible
2. inverse of elementary matrix E is matrix of the same type that transform E back to I

If we want to talk whether a matrix is invertible, it has to be square first

A linear transformation T: $R^m \to R^n$ is invertible if there is a linear function  S that is S(T(x)) = x, T (S(x)) = x for any x. aka. BAx = x BAx = x $\to$ AB = BA = I
