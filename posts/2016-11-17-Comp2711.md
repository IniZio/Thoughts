# Comp2711

Iterating a recurrence: T(n) = rT(n-1) + a $\to$ 

​	General form:  $r^n b + a \sum^{n-1}_{i=0} r^i$ 

Geometric Series: T(n) = $r^n b + a \frac{1-r^n}{1-r}$

​	Sum: $\frac{1-r^n}{1-r}$

Big O notation: Calculate complexity of function

​	f() = O(g()) && g() = O(f()) means they have similar complexity/growth

​	f(h) = $\theta(g())$ means with there are two constants $c_1, c_2$ s.t. f() is within the bound of $c_1g()$ and $c_2 g()$
