Starting point of China in trademark is to protect company's right, whereas in US its is to protect consumer by not confusing them. So in China company can apply for tradmark on non-existant product 

also china have a lot of trademarks with similar names, which confuses consumers

License is like asset, large coorporations often make a deal with the license that they believe can be used to sue others

In US, unless the commerce is interstate, trademark is highly focused in state law
National trademark is important for cyber since cyber squatting and blackmail is national.

How to lose trademark: forgot to renew periodically, or stopped using it + abandoned it, or the trademark has become too generic, or meaning of trademark is deceptive

Advertising is not enough for prove usage of trademark. Token sales also often not enough unless the effort is solid

Infringement of trademark important for exam ;)
- similar marks: design, word similarities, similar sound
- similar combined effect of marks + goods
- similar market
