Face Tagging

1. First store the picture as a vector map of pixels
2. Problem is that it is too costly to store so many pixels, so we want to reduce the dimensions
   This need good choice of direction in $R^2$ that is distinctive among the points in each vector map. Bad choice will cut points incorrectly, impossible to distinguish them. The best distinctive would be in the mean ? Along the good direction you should see clearly divided regions of points
3. How to find the distinctive directions in the vector space of these many vector maps?
   Use "Principle Component Analysis". Find eigenvectors of $AA^T$, where A = ($v_1, v_2, ..$). Each $v_i$ is each image map
   The "distinctive " directions are the eigenvectors with largest eigenvalues
   *Theorem*: If matrix $AA^T$ is diagonalizable, the eigenvectors can be chosen to be orthogonal eigenvalues are non-negative
4. Get the eivenvectors with the "distinctive" directions, choose the top n greatest eigenvalues.
5. Reduce the vector space into span of the top n vectors with orrhogonal basis B = {$u_1, u_2, ...u_n$}
6. To determine a picture match face :
   1. check distance between proj$_H u$ and the stored span of vectors in (5), if it is among between range of span of vectors than it is match
