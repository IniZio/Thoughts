# Math2111

Definition: If {$u_1,...u_p$} is **orthogonal basis** for w,
$\to$ for all v $\in R^n$, $proj_wv = \frac{v\cdot u_1}{||u_1||^2} + ...\frac{v\cdot u_p}{||u_p||^2}$

distance between v and w = ||v-$proj_w v$||

e.g. given u, w are two subspacees of $R^n$, and $proj_vv = proj_wv$ for every v $\in R^n$, so is u = w?
since u has orthogonal basis {$u_1...u_p$}, w has orthorgonal basis {$w_1,...w_p$}, we get the proj of them, and will find that v is in the span of the proj of u and v, so that means u = w, since v is already every possible element in $R^n$

How you handle proj stuff, get the dot products out, remove all the 0's

e.g. $x_1=\begin{bmatrix}1\\0\\1\\0\\1\end{bmatrix}, x_2=\begin{bmatrix}1\\1\\1\\0\\1\end{bmatrix}, x_3=\begin{bmatrix}1\\0\\1\\1\\1\end{bmatrix}$, w = span {$x_1,x_2,x_3$}, let  U = (1,2,a,21)$^T$, find proj$_wu$
First need to find orthogonal basis {$u_1, u_2, u_3$}
$u_1=x_1, u_2 = x_2 - \frac{x_2u_1}{||u_1||^2}u_1 = x_2-u_1, u_3 = ... = x_3 - 0 - u_1 = \begin{bmatrix}0\\0\\0\\1\\0\end{bmatrix}$

, now u get the orthogonal basis, then do the proj$_wu$ using it
