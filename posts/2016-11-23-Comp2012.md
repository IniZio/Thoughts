#### Double Linked List

Considerations when Creating recursion:

1. Termination condition
2. Recursive call
3. Assume the recursive calls itself, its finish its task you assigned and return the correct result

e.g. Destructor for DLL

```cpp
DLL<T>::~DLL() {
  // STEP 1: if meet terminate condition (here head is null), stop
  if (head == 0) return;
  // STEP 2: Delete all nodes beyond itself, believe the recursive part will work
  // method: create temp DLL in block with head->next statically , which automatically calls destructor recursively for the blocks once get outside of block
  {
    DLL remaining_nodes(head->next);
  }
  // STEP 3: Do its own assigned task
  delete head;
  head = 0;
}
```

e.g. Insert for DLL

```cpp
void Dll<T>::insert(const T& x) {
  // STEP 1: create the new node
  Dll_node* p, new_node = new Dll_node(x); 
  // if empty just insert
  if (head == 0) {head = new_node; return;}
  // STEP 2: Find the suitable place to insert
  for (p = head; x > p->data && p->next != 0; p = p->next);
  // STEP 3: insert between the suitable place and its previous node
  if (x > p->data) { new_node->prev = p; p->next = new_node; }
  else if (p == head) { new_node->next = p; p->prev = new_node; head = new_node; }
  else {
    new_node->next = p; new_node->prev = p->prev; // set itself's relation
    p->prev->next = new_node; p->prev = new_node; // set prev's and next's relation
  }
}
```

When doing remove for DLL:

1. search for the node
2. if it is head, point head to its next node, otherwise point its previous node's next to itself's next
3. If it has next node, then point its next node's previous to itself's previous
4. delete itself

Except for not operating on an existing element in list (e.g. insert) , should use `for (const Dll node∗ p = head; p != 0; p = p→next);` if applying operation on all elements
