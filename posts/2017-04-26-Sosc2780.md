# Sosc2780

In early 19th century, hong kong was still close part of china. after opium war+ civil war + cold war

Mainland: redrew from world-economy + radical communism + self-reliance
Taiwan: nationlist government built up on developmental state and promoted export-led industrialization
HK: remained same (laisezz-faire)

problems of HK/taiwan: internal(labor shortage, pollution), external(high currency, competition)

China started with nothing:

- 1975-1980s: tried open-door policy, using join-ventures, provide local materials. but foreigners complained of bureaucracy, restricted labor tl;dr too many restrictions
- Then coastal developmental strategy: economic development & national unification achieved together. target SMEs in HK & taiwan instead of US & europe. didnt mind labor-intensive industries & raw materials import
