==Gram-Schmidt Process==: given a subspace W of an inner product space, find an orthonormal basis of W so that can write the projection matrix $UU^T$.

​	Steps:

	1. ​

==Least Squares Method==: Given a system of inconsistent equations, get the best possible solutions out of the constraints

Ax = b is inconsistent $\Leftrightarrow$ B not $\in$ Col(A)

So we solve 

​	A $x_0 = b_0$ (*)

with $b_0 = proj_{Col(A)}b$

(*) is called Least squares equation, and $x_0$ is least squares solution



###### Strat for LSM:

1. USe Gram-Schmidt to find orthogonal basis of Col(A)
2. find $b_0 = proj_{Col(A)}b$
3. Solve A$x_0 = b_0$  

###### Another strat for LSM: (does not need to find $b_0$, go straight for x)

(orthogonal decomposition) b = $b_0$ + (b-$b_0$)  aka. b = Col(A) - ($Col(A)^{\perp}$) 

since $Col(A)^{\perp}$ = $Nul(A)^{\perp}$

$A^T(b-b_0)$ = 0

$A^T b = A^T b_0$  (*)

####  $x_0$ == x

To solve LSQ:

A$x_0 = b_0​$

###### $(A^T A)x_0 = A^T b$
