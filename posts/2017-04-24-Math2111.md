{$u_1...u_p$} in  $R^n$ is orthogonal set if $u_iu_j$ = 0 if i $\ne$ j



If a set S is orthogonal then it is L.I. then given W = Span S, then S is basis for W.

||UX||$^2$ = (UX)$^T$UX

(UX)$\cdot$(UY) = (UX)$^T$(UY) = $X^TU^TUY$ = $X\cdot Y$

Projection of y = $y_1$ = $\frac{y\cdot u_1}{u_1\cdot u_1}u_1 ...\frac{y\cdot u_p}{u_p\cdot u_p}u_p$. IT is called the orthogonal projection of y onto W



###### Best Approximation theorem

Let W be subspace of $R^n$, for any y $\in R^n$ y = $y_1+y_2$ , who are both in W,
then $y_1$ is the closest point in W to y
That is, for any w $\in$ W, w $\ne$ y, ||y-$y_1$|| $\lt$ ||y-w||
$\to$ $y_1$ is called **best approximation to y** by element of W

###### Gram-Schmidt process

Given basis B = {$a_1,...a_n$} for W

define
$v_1$ = $a_1$, $v_2$ = $a_2 -\frac{a_2\cdot v_1}{v_1\cdot v_1}v_1$, $v_3$ = ...
$\to$ {$v_1, v_2,...v_n$} is orthogonal basis for W

$v_1$ = $a_1$ $\in span\{a_1\} = W_1$, $a_2$ = $Proj_{w_1}a_2 + v_2$ = $\frac{a_2\cdot v_1}{v_1\cdot v_1}v_1 + v_2$
