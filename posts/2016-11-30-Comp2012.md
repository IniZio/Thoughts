# Comp2012

https://course.cse.ust.hk/comp2012/web/notes/L2/12-hashing-full.pdf

Possible methods to hash strings:

1. (doesnt work) each character has its own id, add them up in a string as the id
2. (doesnt work) (1+27+27^2) mod m, Waste space as only 28% actually able to be hashed
3. kind of same to method 2 except do the sequence on the whole string instead of first 3

Hash collision handling:

1. Separate chaining:  instead of using hash table as a simple table, use it as table of linked lists. So even if using same hash, they are chained on a separated linked list (pushed like stack for strings with same hash). Expect each entry only have short list, as it only add up with hash collision
   So even if it has low effectiveness, its the hash function's fault, not this method's
   Operation (insert): compute hash $\to$ if is null pointer initialize the entry as first node, else add it to beginning of list

2. Open addressing: if find the entry is already occupied, then find another place in hash table. 

   a. Linear Probing: E.g. (P.22)

   | Table index | Insert 89 | Insert 18 | Insert 49 | Insert 58 | Insert 69 |
   | ----------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | --------- |
   | 0           |           |           | 49        | 49        | 49        |
   | 1           |           |           |           | 58        | 58        |
   | 2           |           |           |           |           | 69        |
   | 3           |           |           |           |           |           |
   | 4           |           |           |           |           |           |
   | 5           |           |           |           |           |           |
   | 6           |           |           |           |           |           |
   | 7           |           |           |           |           |           |
   | 8           |           | 18        | 18        | 18        | 18        |
   | 9           | 89        | 89        | 89        | 89        | 89        |

   Since it stops searching at empty cell when searching for a hash key, it generally never delete hash keys

   b. Quadratic Probing:  unlike linear probing, for the i^th^ attempt, it goes back to the first collision of the hash, then got $i^2$ place
   It reduces clustering in linear i.e. Hash filled entries stick together, by making the jumping distances different

3. Double hashing:  Since Quadratic Probing still have problem of clustering, we make the jumping independent of its first collision position.
   $h_i$(k) = (hash(k) + i $\times$ hash$_2$(k)) mod m

   hash$_2$() must not have result 0 and have to be relatively prime to table size, not to waste time. One way: hash$_2$(k) = R - (k mod R), makes m prime and R is prime number smaller than mvue
   Operation: Hash twice:(e.g. 28) 

   | Table index | Insert 89 | Insert 18 | Insert 49 | Insert 58 | Insert 69 |
   | ----------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | --------- |
   | 0           |           |           |           |           | 69        |
   | 1           |           |           |           |           |           |
   | 2           |           |           |           | 58        | 58        |
   | 3           |           |           |           |           |           |
   | 4           |           |           |           |           |           |
   | 5           |           |           |           |           |           |
   | 6           |           |           | 49        | 49        | 49        |
   | 7           |           |           |           |           |           |
   | 8           |           | 18        | 18        | 18        | 18        |
   | 9           | 89        | 89        | 89        | 89        | 89        |
