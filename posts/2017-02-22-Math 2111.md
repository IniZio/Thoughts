### Ch 1.5  homogenous system

For linear systeme Ax = b, if b == 0 then it is homogenous system, else not

#### if is Homogenous 

Homogenous sytems has at least 1 solution (trivial solution)

Since last columns of the augmented matrix of homogenous system is all 0's anyway, so can do the row operations on the coefficient matrix only and see if unique solutions or infinite

Basic variables are the pivots, free variables the rest

#### If is non-homogenous

if $u_1$ and $u_2$ are two solutions of Ax = b, then $u_1-u_2$ is solution of Ax = 0

If Ax=b is a consitent system with particular system $u_0$, then solution of Ax=b is set of all vectors of form u = $u_0 + w$ 



##### Linear independence

set of vectors {$v_1,v_2,...$} is L.I. if $c_1v_1+c_2v_2+.... = 0$ has only the trivial solution



Let S = {$v_1,v_2,...$},

1. if 0 $\in$S then it is L.I.
2. if dimension of v's  < No. of vectors then L.D
3. if only 1 non-zero vector then L.I.
4. If No. of vectors > 2 and is L.D. $\Leftrightarrow$ theres is $v_j$ that is L.c. of {$v_1,v_2...v_{j-1}$}
