13. A = $\begin{bmatrix}2&3\\0&2\end{bmatrix}$, find $PDP^{-1}$
    det (A - $\lambda$ I) = 0, we get det = $(2-\lambda)^2$, so is $\lambda$ = 2, and is double, so D = $\begin{bmatrix}2&0\\0&2\end{bmatrix}$, using it find P as well

14. Let $u_1 \perp v_1$ and $u_2 \perp v_2$, is it always that $(u_1+u_2) \perp (v_1+v_2)$
    do a dot product between them, and then prove it gets into zero or not

1.(i) 3 $\times$ 2 + 2 $\times$ (-3) = 0, so is orthogonal

2.is diagonal

3.(i) since $W^{\perp}$ = { x $\in R^n | x \perp w$ }, W $\land$ $W^{\perp}$ = 0
