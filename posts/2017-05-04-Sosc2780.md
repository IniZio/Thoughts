# Sosc2780

Keynesian: to save capitalism, state intervene in market. e.g. Deficit financing, progress taxation, regulations $\to$ welfare state in west, developmental state in south, radical socialist experiment in east

Neo-liberalism: to fight against Keynesian economic policies. e.g de-regulation to liberate market, downsize state, privatization of public sector, more competition

hyper-capitalism: accelerated commodification.
consumer capital: production change to marketing.
finance capital: assist capitalist production change to a means of capital accumulation in its own right

------

Statism: territorial, bureaucratic, centralized, comprehensive, exclusive

statism challenged by supra-territoriality: socio-economic interaction happends outside boundary, state lose control of activities

Transformation of statism:

- towards global constituencies: protect national $\to$ not that distinguishable, serve global to promote national interest
- pressure on welfare: take care of citizens $\to$ reverse welfare, shift burden to private sector
- focus changed from government to governance: institution to process of how authoritative decision is made

Polycentric governance:

- upward: regional level (APEC), deal with global problems. poor coordination, under-funded, low legitimacy
- downward: sub-state (local governments), can bypass central state with other supra-state agencies
- sideward: growth happen cross state-border. border province set up trans-border agenciesss
- outwards: to privatized governance. gated factories, gated housing

------

Nation: territorial, mutually constitutive, unique traits, fused with state
State: formal institution of power and governance

globalization changes nationalism: weakens nationalism (people move across states), enhances nationalism (olympic , concept of 'foreigners')

Transformation of nationalism: persistance of nation-state (eduation, pro-national communication), rise of micro nations (Tibet), plural national identities (region-nations(pan-asian), transworld(Jews), non-territorial(religion))

Hybridization: trans-migrant. identify surfing

------

social contract between big capital, big labor, big governement in 1950s-70s: periodic increase in wages to keep up with rise in productivity & inflation

globalization project: dismantle welfare and liberate market. 

Flexible employment: spatial (trans-border), temporal (part-time), functional (multi-task), wage (piece work)

Why hk fits FE: it already had it, weak state, fragmented unions, financial crisis, industries were relocated across border

FE spread to different sectors, different occupations, and state

Impact of FE: social life (life stages), intensity (can be fired), social solidarity (no time to form groups), propensity to strike (disposable, cant bargain)

------

Explain east-asia development:

- market: engage in world market (promote globalization)
- cultural: confucianism values conducive to development (education, authoritarianism)
- statist: focuses only on development, using carrots + sticks (justify intervention)
- world-system: look into world-system 

------

Japan used ideology of 'anti-imperialist imperialism': Pan-asian rhetoric to resist Western.
Got KO'ed by US in 1920s, used open-door policy, balance of power, peaceful competition among imperial powers

Debate on whether chinese communism winning due to nationalist or communist:

- communist: it is a peasant problem, is the basis
- nationalist: they won only because they took role as nationalist in WWII

------

Withdrawal of chrina from capitalist economy:

1. withdrawal phase: economic embargo, strict border, invisible in global affairs
2. radical socialist policy: land reform (eliminate landlords), collectivization (eliminate rich peasant, no private property), nationalization of industry, work unit model, hundred-flowers campaign (attack intellectuals), great leap forward, break with Soviet union, attack party-state in cultural revolution

Strong communist party-state: autonomy $\uparrow$ after destroying old ruling classes, capacity $\uparrow$ to do radical policies (from city to village), high legitimacy in doing socialist experiments (nationalist)

Why maybe socialist experiment didnt suck that much:

- had nice economic growth compared to 3rd world
- significant industrialization
- made communist party have autonomy, capacity, legitimacy
- commune model and decentralization policy made easy to facilitate local resources (leaders, natural, initiatives)
- increased agricultural productivity, emerge fast from local official

------

China leave socialism:

- fading of cold war gave china chance to get back in capitalist
- other asian neighbors impressed china, so china copied that, and at that time the asian neighbors suffered from high cost, so china opened door
- social dissatisfaction of low income, bored of political campaigns
- against ultra-leftism. want to call an end to never-ending social mobilization
- triggers: mao died, severe national disasters
- slippery economic reforms: before there were many restrictions, Deng made 'market socialism' i.e. 'crossing river by groping stones', eventually slips to neo-liberalism


Neoliberal reform policies: re-invent & liberate market from state and reintegrate china into capitalist world-economy

Neoliberalism stages:

1. de-collectivization: peasants given their own land, own gain & loss. Village and township enterprises created
2. proletaranization: peasants have to face charges for education, medical. this makes them seek work elsewhere.
3. marketization policy: labor market introduced, creating flexible labor force. state enterprises no longer needa give life-long employment
4. fiscal decentralization: localities can submit a portion of revenue and use the rest
5. open up + spatial differentiation: enter capitalist faster by cutting back tariffs, loosen control over foreign exchange, decentralize import/export decisions. special economic zones set up

$\to$ very uneven pattern of spatial development

What makes china's neo-liberalism different:

- market was non-existent
- state was dominent
- pause or reverse when in trouble
- state still monopolize strategic industry
- goal is not to dismantle communism and instead keep communist party-state in power
- no blueprint, trial and error


------

Explain Japanese economic miracle:

- good state-business relations
- life-long employment, company loyalty: got super-profits from colonies, so could pay workers high benefits, also cuz lack of labor, and learnt from western fails
- threat of colonialism (far away from trade route + incorporation)

Japan after WWII: US wanted a **weak** Japan: demilitarize, land reform, breaking up Zaibatsu & democratization. encourage unionzation
Japan in late 1940s: US wanted a **strong** Japan: give contracts, open US market to japanese products, helped Japan secure raw material from other asian nations, tolerate japan setting up import & investment restrictions
