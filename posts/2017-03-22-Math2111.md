# Math2111

e.g. Find whether H = {(x,y,z) | -4x + 9y + 2z = 7} is sub-space of $R^3$
since if all x,y,z =0, then the condition -4$\cdot$0+9$\cdot$0 + 2$\cdot$0 = 0 $\ne$ 7, it is not vector space, not sub-space of $R^3$

e.g. Find whether H = {(-7x, 4x, 9x) | x arbitary number}

1. D is $\in$ $R^3$
2. when x = 0, it is (0,0,0)
3. u + v is also in H
4. when multiply c, it still is (-7cx, 4cx, 9cx)

To check if two spans equal, find both spans are $\in$ each other. To check if is $\in$ another span, go through each element and see if it can be presented with another span

**Null space of A is the solution set of Ax=0**

**Column space of A is span of columns of A**
Col A is subspace of $R^n$. 
b $\in$ Col A $\Leftrightarrow$ Ax = b is consistent

Row A is also subspace of $R^n$ since it is Col $A^T$
