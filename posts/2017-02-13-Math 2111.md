# Math 2111

A = $\begin{pmatrix}a_{11}...a_{1n}\\a_{m1}....a_{mn}\end{pmatrix}$ : m rows, n cols

Leading entry: First non-zero entry in a a row****

**REF** if:

1. All full-0's rows are at bottom
2. Each leading entry of a row is in a column to the right to the leading entry of the row above it e.g. $\begin{pmatrix}1 0 0 ...\\0 1 0...\\0 0 1...\end{pmatrix}$
3. All stuff below leading entry are 0's****

**RREF** if:

1. REF
2. leading entry in each row is 1
3. leading entry is the only non-zero in its column

Pivot position: location of leading 1 in each column in RREF

Pivot column: Column that contains a pivot

Way to REF:

1. Begin with leftmost non-zero column
2. Select with leading entry in each row
3. use row replacement operations to create 0's in the position that the leading entry is in
4. Focus on the submatrix, Repeat step (1) - (3) until there are no modifiable non-zero rows

Way to RREF:

- REF's step (1)-(4)

5. Scale all leading entries to 1
6. For all ==rightmost== leading entry, make all entries above them 0's
