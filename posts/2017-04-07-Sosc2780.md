# Sosc2780

### Fading of cold war
- US fought 10 years in Vietnam but still could not conquer, so had to sign peace agreement and no longer the dominant super power
- So US welcomed China back to CWE, shown by Kissinger's 1971 visit in Beijing. China displaced Taiwan in UN, diplomatic relationship between US and China
- China wanted the similr success of its neighbours who took the path of export-led industrialization. In return those neighbours had problem of high cost in production. So China opened its door for foreign investment

Problem in China then:
- people are tired of the meetings/campaigns of class struggle due to generations fading
- since new generations are more receptive of ecnomic form changes (e.g. privatizationi), it transitioned to 'market socialism' and labeled it as 'crossing the river by groping the stones'
- It was not just a slight space for privation in the beginning, but then the market quickly expanded. It is therefore a slippery, unintentional act to make such a big transaction

Proletarianizattion of peasants:
- they are forced to go to urban areas to work since schools, medical care need charges, and frural migrants flooded

Marketizatioin policy: restore/expand the market from state sector
- labor market introduced in 1980s, so state enterprises no long need to give life-long employment, instead they can fire/hire workers to increase producitivity, for neo-liberalism

The neo-liberalism of China is differnt from west though, since the market is not dominent and the state is still very strong
Also the goal of neo-liberalism is different for china, it does not strip communists of power and instead haev state stay in power. And the speed of China reform as gradual, adaptive process without blueprint, with frequent corrections and reversals
