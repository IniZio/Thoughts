# Sosc 2780

Assumptions of modernization school

- Evolutionary: is unilinear e.g. different country have different speed of revolution, but at ideal they all change gradually and evolve
- Functionalist: for imcompatitable systems(e.g. some traditional and modern values). Need to find crititcal variable

###### Critism (1) : should not use unilinear development for third world

Unilinear assumption is ethnocentric(aka biased to urself). E.g. assume the Wes is advanced and that third world is backward. 

Multi-linear development means  third word has a choice of paths instead of following the West. 

Non-development is a possible result where instead of getting better, the thirld is getting worse

###### Critism (2): Traditional have to replaced by modern?

It is often hard to define tradition since it shouldnt be defined be wtever not modern. And it often is not impossible to coexist with modern. For instance although communist was more modern than confusianism and it May 4th movement was done to remove confusianism, they coexist nowadays

###### Critism (3): Methodological Problem

Should create methods of learning current / old methods instead of neglecting them and using new methods already
