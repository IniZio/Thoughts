# Math 2111

## Ch1.1

Summary:

1. Linear equation $a_1x_1$+.... + $a_nx_n$ = b
2. Linear system: collection of linear equations
3. Solution set S of it means it satisfy the system when x = $s_n$
4. Way to solve linear system: Try to simplify the system til answer is right there

**Elementary Row Operations**: *Does not change solution set of linear system*

| ERO's       | ???                                      |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Interchange | Interchange two rows                     |
| Scaling     | Multiply all terms in a row w/ a constant |
| Replacement | Do Scaling on a row and add another row to it |

Row equivalence: One matrix afters some ERO is same as another matrix. 



## Ch 1.2

If there is a zero-row, then either infinite solutions or no solution

**Echelon Form**:

1. All non-zero row are above any rows of all zeros
