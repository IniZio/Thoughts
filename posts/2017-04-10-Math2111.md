# Math2111

n$\times$n matrix A is diagonlizable if & only if A has n L.I. eigenvectors

To get eigenvector:

1. get eigenvalue through det (A - $\lambda I$) = 0
2. solve the homogenous equation (A- $\lambda$I)x = 0

$\to$ x is the eigenvector

$A^{2017}$ = $(PDP^{-1})^{2017}$ = $PD^{2017}P^{-1}$



inner product of two vectors: u $\cdot$ v = $u^T$v

norm of vector means getting length of vector
