# Comp2021

Perl have different expectation of whether to get scalar or vector, esp. array to variable
`$n = @nums`: $n will get length of it
`($n) = @nums`: $n will get first element of it
`@nums = 1`: Will assign a single-element array to @nums

`@a[0,1,3] = @a[1,1,1]`: assigns the 2nd element to 1st, 2nd, 4th element of @a

`@b = (1, 3, 5, 7)[2,3]`: assign the temp array 3rd and 4rd elements to @b

additional control flow statements:

- unless
- until

foreach is kinda like js `map`, is pass by reference
foreach with `$_`:

```perl
foreach (@a) {
  print "$_\t"; # or just print;
}
```



Backword if: `print ("HI") if ($user eq "iniz")`

Hash:

```perl
my %planets =(
Mercury => 0,
Venus => 1,
Earch => 2,
);

for each my $name (keys %planets) {
  printf "%s %s\n", $name, $planets{$name}
}
```
