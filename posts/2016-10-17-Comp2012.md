## L2

- can define function in struct in C++, but not in C
- in C it is hard to maintain relatinships between structure data members
- OOP properties:
  - class
  - objects
  - inheritence
  - polymophism
  - dynamic binding
- Supports in OOP:
  - Data abstraction (abstract data type)
  - Data enscuplation (information hiding)

- inline functions are suitiable for short/simple statements, less readable
- if not put inline keyword, compilor will decide whether to make it inline
- if add inline to function, then it will become inline no matter what
- variable chooses the nearest declaration/initialiation value

## L6

- with g++ command, link other libraries using '-l' option
- a c++ library is of extension '.a', and has a prefix 'lib'
  e.g. `g++ -o myprog myprog.o -l ABC` finds a library called 'libABC.a'

### Static linking vs dynamic linking

- Static:
  - run faster
  - larger file size
- Dynamic:
  - run slower
  - less portable as the machine may not have the library
  - smaller file size

### #include `<>` vs #include ""

- \#: preprossor directive
- `<>`: standard header files
- "": user-defined header files searched in current directory. Can be changed with '-I' option

### 3 lines of codes in header file

```cpp
#IFNDEF HAHA_H
#DEFINE HAHA_H

#ENDIF
```

## L5

#### Passing objects

- Should nearly always pass objects as reference. If for getters then add 'const' in function parameter

#### Differences between Reference and Pointer

- Pointer can be pointed at nothing(NULL), reference cant
- Pointer can point to different objects at different times, reference cant. Instead assignments to it is applied to the value of its referenced object
- Nme of pointer refers to pointer object, so uses `*` and `->`. Name of reference always refers to the object

## Usage of const

- ojects not intend to change
- funcstion arguments not intend to change
- member functions that do not change data members (e.g. getters)

## ALERT! never assign values to data members in initialization

```cpp
clas abc {
	private:
	int good;
	// int bad = 1; // cuz it errors in old compiler
}
```

### If there is char string in parameter of constructor, then it won't call default constructor even if the object declaration does not have any parameters (four/constrctor.cpp)

`int a(10)` works and is same as `int a = 10`

## L6

```cpp
class Word{
public:
	explicit Word()
}
```

- 'explicit' is like preventDefault in js

### Copy constructor

```cpp
class A {
public:
	A(const A& a) {
		x = a.x;
		y = a.y;
	}
	A reflect() { return *this } // this also calls a copy constructor
}
```

#### When a copy constructor is triggered

- When u pass a object as parameter (normal copy)
- When u return an object by value in the function

#### Why use copy constructor

- Control level of copy/ what to copy

#### There is a default copy constructor too, which copies all data members one by one

##### Problem with default copy constructor

- Pointers copy the address so is kind of same, instead of copied to become independent(a.k.a shallow copying)

```cpp
class A {
private:
	int* arr; // Notice this pointr of array
public:
	A() { arr = new int[10];}
};

int main() {
	A obj1;
	A obj2(obj1);
}
```

#### Correct way to make pointer deep copied as well

```cpp
class A {
private:
	int* arr; // Notice this pointr of array
public:
	A() { arr = new int[10];}
	A(const A& a) {
		arr = new int[10];
		for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
			arr[i] = a.arr[i];
		}
	};
};
```

```cpp
Word hkust = "hkust" // implicit conversion constructor
```

## L7

#### Member initialization list

```cpp
class A {
private:
	int a, b, c;
	const int d;
	// member initialization list
	A(): a(1), b(2), c(3), d(4){ // this way directly assigns and initializes the values at the same time
	}
	// is the same as:
	A() {
		a = 1; b=2;c=3; // this way will initialize the members before assigning the values
		d = 4 // illegal
	}
}
```

## L8

#### when copy a char string to another char string, the length in new must be +1-ed:

```cpp
void receive_string(const char* s = "abc") {
  char* str = new char[strlen(s)+1]; strcpy(str, s);
}
```

##### When an object is already constructed, assigning another object to it does not trigger constructor

##### A object is killed before its data members. Reason: C++ stores the programs and variables as stack, and data members are constructed first i.e. FILO

#### If in constructor we assigned a data member a object:

```cpp
tree A;
World() {
  A = tree(1);
}
```

it gives two destructor. one for the data member itself, one for the tree(1), which is another unnamed but created object



## L9

### Generic programming

```cpp
template <typename T>
  T my_max(const T& a, const T& b) {
    return (a>b)?a:b;
  }
int main() { int c = my_max(10, 11); }
```

- ==*== If you pass parameters with different types at once though it will give error e.g. `double c = my_max(4,5.5)`

  - solution: (use a new typename for each parameter possibly with different type )

    ```cpp
    template <typename T1, typename T2>
      T my_max(const T1& a, const T2& b) {
        return (a>b)?a:b;
      }
    int main() { int c = my_max(10, 11); }
    ```

- Cannot set `typename` for return type

- It is useful for container classes e.g.

  ```cpp
  template <typename T>
    class A {
      private:
      T* arr;
      public:
      A () {arr = new T[100];}
    }
  int main() {
    A <int> something;
  }
  ```

### Operator overloading

- What you see: `c =a+b`
  Whtat c++ does: `int c = operator+(a,b)`,  or `int c = a.operator+(b)`
- handilling `<<` or `>>`: `ostream & operator<<(ostream& os, const A& x) {...} `, ` istream & operator<<(istream& os, const A& x) {...} `

## L10

##### Unlike normal functions, templates i.e. `template <typename T>`cannot be separated to header and cpp files.
