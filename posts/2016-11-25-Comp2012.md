# Comp2012

Height of tree: root to lowest node

Maximum height for tree is straight line

'Good' tree: if it is balanced side-by-side

Converting generic tree to binary tree: only connect one node from root, others at same level connect each other 

Reverse Polish Notation = postfix notation
Advantage: does not need parentheses (instead adjust orders of operands), and can solve easily with stack

Application of binary tree:

- Express math expressions: leaves are operands, internal nodes are operators
  preorder (prefix):++a\*bc\*+\*defg
  inorder(infix): a+b\*c+d\*e+f\*g 
  postorder(postfix): abc\*+de\*f+g\*+ (or use stack)

Binary Search Tree: data structure for searching, inserting and deletion

​	ALl keys in left sub tree are smaller than the one of node itself
​	All keys in its right are larger than the node itself

###  Apply action on all tree nodes

==LevelOrder==: From top to bottom, left to right

#### ==Inorder==: (LCR i.e. Left->current->Right)

```cpp
template <class T>
 void btree_inorder(Btree_node<T> * root, void (*action)(Btree_node<T> *r)) {
   if (root) {
     btree_inorder(root->getLeft(), action);
     action(root);
     btree_inorder(root->getRight(), action);
   }
 }
```



#### ==PostOrder==: (LRC)

```cpp
//same for line 1-3
	  btree_inorder(root->getLeft(), action);
	  btree_inorder(root->getRight(), action);
      action(root);
//same for line 7-8
```



#### ==PreOrder==: (CLR)

```cpp
//same for line 1-3
      action(root);
	  btree_inorder(root->getLeft(), action);
	  btree_inorder(root->getRight(), action);
//same for line 7-8
```
