10.(ii)

Need to find P s.t. PA = B. P should be 2$\times$2

since A $\to$ B is $-r_2+r_1$, should do the same process on I to get P, so is $\begin{pmatrix}1&-1\\0&1\end{pmatrix}$

1.**Symmetic** means $A^T=A$, **skew-symmetric** means $A^T=-A$
(i). since transpose is rows to columns,
x - y = 3
2x-y+z = 4,
x+z=1
$\to$ solve them and done

(ii) similar, except needa negative every element first

3.Orthogonal means $A^TA=AA^T=I$
since we will find the transpose is actually same, that means we get AA=$\begin{bmatrix}cos^2\theta+sin^2\theta&0\\0&cos^2\theta+sin^2\theta\end{bmatrix}$$\Rightarrow$ $\begin{bmatrix}1&0\\0&1\end{bmatrix}$. basically every $\theta$
