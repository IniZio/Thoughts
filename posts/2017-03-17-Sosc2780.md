Before globalization, people tend to stay in local communiy (e.g. HK old generations)

Benedict Andeson states that "nation is imagined community", which means ntion is not natural and needs to be socially constructed, with characteristics:

- territorial
- mutually constitutive (constructed through interaction with other nations) (e.g. China's nation building happended in era of Imperialism)
- unique traits (e.g. language, religion, customs)

State is official substitution of nation

Globalization challenges nationalism:

1. massive flow of ppl across state boundaries: 
   - languages, races, customs are interpreeted, losing uniqueness
   - cut down roots, social ties since people move away from their original countries
   - erosioin of state authority
2. Some ways that globalization positively reinforces nationalism tho:
   - olympics games
   - increased contact with foreigners heighten national awareness, provokes defensive move

Rise of micro nations:

- insigenous groups seek secession to create their own nation-state e.g. Tibet.
- seen as self-protective resistance to homogenization (e.g universities against manadrin as reqeuired language course)

Emergence of plural national identities

- region-nations

Hybridization:

- peopler have several stands, esp. immigrants
- trans-migrant: tranvel all the time, related ppl in different places
- identify surfing: sense of fluit and fragmented self
