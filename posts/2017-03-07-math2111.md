Given matrix A is mxn, Domain is $R^n$ (column), codomain is $R^m$ (row)

If columns $\gt$ rows $\to$ not one-to-one (since not all are pivot columns)

If columns = rows $\to$ both onto & one-to-one

If all rows have pivot positions $\to$ onto

one-to-one means Ax=0 only trivial

onto means Ax=b is consistent

Onto & one-to-one relationships for matrix A (m$\times$n):

| comparison | result            |
| ---------- | ----------------- |
| n $\le$ m  | one-to-one        |
| n $\ge$ m  | onto              |
| n = m      | onto & one-to-one |
| n > m      | not one-to-one    |
| n < m      | not onto          |
