# Comp 2021

Nature of users for security:

- Access to files depend on user account
- All accounts are under root
- each user have absolute control over its own files (wt if I `dhown`)

`chmod [ugoa][+-=][rwx] <file/dir>` : change permission to user/group/others/all e.g. `chmod a+x omg.s `

Execution permission of directory determines if user can 'go' into it. E.g. `cd`, `cat` a file in it

Read permission of directory determines if can know wt files are in it

Permission to a file need to go through the folder permissions wrapping it first

**Link**: directory entry pointing to blocks on disk

`ln`: creates ==hard== link , strictly speaking just another name for the same file. Same inode

`ln -s`: creates ==soft== link to path name instead of file itself. DIfferent inode

No way to tell how many symbolic links to filez



### Regex

`^`: 1.  beginning of the the phrase already need to start match. 2. if in the middle then its negate

`$`: end of the pattern also need to be end of the phrase

`.`: any character except `\n`

`[abc]`: any one of the choices 'a', 'b', 'c'

`0-9`: 0 to 9 are match

`(abc){<min>, <max>}` limit of repititions of abc

`\w` = `[a-zA-Z0-9_]`

`\s` = `[ \t\n]`

###### Multipliers:

- `(abc)*`: 0 or more of previous pattern
- `(abc)+`: like `*` but 1 or more
- `(abc)?`:  0 or 1 of previous pattern
